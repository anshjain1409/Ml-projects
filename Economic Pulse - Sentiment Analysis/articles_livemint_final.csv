Reeves Says Trump’s Tariffs Will Hurt UK Even If Britain Secures US Deal,https://www.livemint.com/economy/reeves-says-trump-s-tariffs-will-hurt-uk-even-if-britain-secures-us-deal-11743608628092.html,"The UK will be hit by the global impact of US tariffs even if ministers succeed in their mission to secure an exemption for British goods, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said.
The government won’t rush into responding to any tariffs that the White House announces later today, Britain’s finance minister told the House of Commons Treasury Committee on Wednesday. “First of all, let’s see how other countries and other trading blocs respond,” she said.
UK ministers and officials are working hard to secure a new economic deal with the US that would ultimately exempt Britain from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. While Reeves said “we won’t do anything to put that in jeopardy,” she emphasized that even if an agreement is reached, Britain isn’t immune from the global effects of US trade policy and reciprocal tariffs worldwide.
“If we are able to secure an economic agreement with the United States, which we very much want to secure, and are working hard to secure, even if that is possible, it doesn’t mean that somehow we are therefore out of the woods and not impacted by tariffs,” Reeves said. “The specific tariffs on the UK are less relevant to the growth and inflation impacts than the global picture because we are an open trading economy and depressed demand from overseas because of tariffs, higher inflation overseas because of tariffs has a direct impact on the UK.”
The government is in discussions with the European Union and other countries about their plans, Reeves added. She said she had spoken to European Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis shortly appearing before the committee. The chancellor also revealed to the panel that she and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds met UK exporters in the morning.
“They don’t want the government to rush into any response because the prize on offer is an economic agreement,” she said. “We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves. We are still in discussions with our counterparts in the United States.”
Speaking about her recent spring statement, Reeves said she decided to restore the £9.9 billion margin she enjoyed at the budget in October against her fiscal rule, but that had since been erased by higher borrowing cost and weaker growth, because it was “necessary in an uncertain world.”
“There’s a balancing act when you’re doing a spring statement or a budget,” Reeves said. “Everything being equal, of course it would be nice to have more headroom, but that would require decisions that as a government we weren’t willing to take” around tax rises or spending cuts.
The headroom against her stricture that tax receipts should fund day-to-day government spending was returned to match almost precisely the amount previously set aside. Reeves said that was “by accident, rather than design.”

RBI Said to Ask Lenders to Report More Offshore Swap Trades,https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-said-to-ask-lenders-to-report-more-offshore-swap-trades-11741674078921.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg India on WhatsApp for exclusive content and analysis on what billionaires, businesses and markets are doing. Sign up here.
India’s central bank asked lenders to widen the scope of reporting offshore interest rate derivative trades as it seeks to better manage overseas flows, according to people familiar with the developments.
The Reserve Bank of India has requested foreign banks operating in India to report details of all offshore trades involving rupee interest rate products, the people said, adding the disclosure would help enhance oversight of client positions. Currently, not all offshore trades are reported, especially those carried out by overseas lenders with offshore clients outside of India market hours, they added.
Senior RBI officials recently met with several lenders, asking them to increase reporting of non-deliverable overnight index swap rates to the central bank or the clearing house it supervises, the people said, asking not to be identified as the mater is private.
The discussions come as offshore trading of Indian financial instruments grows, with daily average offshore dollar-rupee trades tripling to $46 billion in 2022, according to the most recent triennial survey from the Bank for International Settlements. The central bank is looking to bring these trades onshore, partly to reduce the divergence in rates between the two markets and limit volatility in local markets, they said.

An email to the central bank seeking comment on the matter went unanswered. The central bank’s October report noted the growth of the offshore derivatives markets and the “wide variation” between overseas and onshore rates.
NDOIS are over-the-counter interest rate derivatives settled based on exchange rate differences rather than actual currency delivery. Some offshore investors prefer these instrument to bet on the direction of Indian interest rates rather than the onshore market, which is under the RBI’s oversight.
In 2019, the RBI allowed overseas investors into India’s rupee interest rate swap market via foreign-currency settled OIS contracts, benchmarked to the Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate. All such trades are to be reported to the Clearing Corp. of India.

"March saw highest ever property registration in Mumbai, ahead of hike in reckoner rates from April 2025",https://www.livemint.com/economy/march-saw-highest-ever-property-registration-in-mumbai-ahead-of-hike-in-reckoner-rates-from-april-2025-11743573709519.html,"Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], April 2 (ANI): Mumbai real estate market saw a notable surge in housing registrations in March 2025, with the number of unit registrations up by 10 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to 15,501 units. The total value of registered properties also spiked by 42 per cent YoY, to₹265 billion.
According to a research report by Nuvama, higher registrations were done because reckoner rates are going to increase by 3.4 per cent in Mumbai and 3.9 per cent for Maharashtra from this month (April, 2025).
This growth is attributed to advance purchases by consumers ahead of the expected hike in ready reckoner rates, set to take effect from the current month (April 2025).
According to the report, about 80 per cent of the registrations during the month were of residential properties.
Registrations of units below 500 sft fell by 38 per cent in March from 48 per cent (YoY), while units between 500-1000 sft increased to 48 per cent from 43 per cent (YoY). Units over 1000 sft increased to 14 per cent from 9 per cent in March 2024.
The report highlighted that the overall market performance in FY25 was exceptional, with registrations reaching an all-time high. The number of units registered surged 9 per cent yearly, while the value saw a 22 per cent YoY increase, totalling₹2.2 trillion.
In Maharashtra, the increase was even more pronounced, with March registrations climbing 11 per cent YoY and 30 per cent month-on-month (MoM) to 185,071 units.
A rise in the average ticket size, up 29 per cent YoY to₹17.1 million, also reflected a shift in buyer behaviour, with higher-priced units dominating the market. Notably, properties priced above₹20 million saw a 19 per cent share in registrations, up from 16 per cent a year ago.
Suburbs in central and western Mumbai dominated sales, accounting for 78 per cent of the total registrations, with central suburbs seeing an increase in their market share. The market's buoyancy was further driven by a robust launch pipeline and a cut in mortgage rates, indicating a healthy outlook for the city's housing sector.
Organised developers, including major players like Lodha, Oberoi, Godrej Properties, Sunteck, and Rustomjee, are expected to benefit from this trend, the report added. (ANI)

India’s services sector growth sees sharp uptick in Feb on new work orders amid strong demand: PMI,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-services-sector-growth-sees-sharp-uptick-in-feb-on-new-work-orders-amid-strong-demand-pmi-11741154373109.html,"New Delhi, Mar 5 (PTI) India's services sector activity witnessed a sharp uptick in February boosted by improving domestic and international demand, which resulted in a quicker expansion in output and a substantial increase in employment, a monthly survey said on Wednesday.
The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Services PMI Business Activity Index rose from January's 26-month low of 56.5 to 59.0 in February, indicating a sharp rate of expansion.
In the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below 50 denotes contraction.
""India's services business activity index rose to 59.0 in February 2025, up considerably from January's 26-month low of 56.5. Global demand, which grew at its fastest pace in six months according to the new export business index, played a major role in driving output growth for India’s services sector,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC.
According to the survey, productivity gains, favourable underlying demand and greater intake of new business.
Moreover, gains in international orders supported this uptick in growth, with service providers reporting better demand from clients in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas and the Middle East, the survey said.
In order to accommodate for rising new business and alleviate capacity pressures, Indian services firms continued to pursue recruitment drives. Employment expanded sharply, and at one of the fastest rates seen since data collection began in December 2005.
""Job creation and charge inflation remained strong during February. Looking ahead, business sentiment remains broadly positive, but did slightly slip last month to its lowest level since August 2024,"" Bhandari said.
Advertising, better customer relations, efficiency gains and healthy demand conditions all underpinned upbeat projections for output in the year ahead. Around one-quarter of survey members forecast growth in the year ahead, while fewer than 2 per cent were pessimistic.
Meanwhile, the HSBC India Composite Output Index rose from 57.7 to 58.8, indicating a substantial rate of expansion.
Composite PMI indices are weighted averages of comparable manufacturing and services PMI indices. Weights reflect the relative size of the manufacturing and service sectors, according to official GDP data.
At the composite level, payroll numbers expanded at a marked pace that was little changed from January's survey record, while cost pressures across the private sector were at their least intense since last October, the survey said.
The HSBC India Services PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 service sector companies.
On the domestic macroeconomic front, the Indian economy grew by 6.2 per cent in the December quarter, recovering sequentially from seven-quarter lows, but the expansion came in lower than last year.
For the full 2024-25 fiscal (April 2024 to March 2025), the government now pegs GDP growth at 6.5 per cent, marginally higher than its initial estimate of 6.4 per cent but below the revised growth rate of 9.2 per cent for 2023-24.
The growth in the current fiscal and less than 7 per cent expected in the next will keep India as the fastest-expanding major economy.

China Banks Increase Consumer Loan Rates to Protect Margins,https://www.livemint.com/economy/china-banks-increase-consumer-loan-rates-to-protect-margins-11743406580468.html,"Chinese banks have begun raising consumer loan interest rates just about two weeks after cutting them to record lows, underscoring the challenges of lowering funding costs amid sustained pressure on margins.
Lenders including China Merchants Bank Co. and Bank of Jiangsu Co., which previously engaged in a price war by offering consumer loan rates as low as 2.58% annually, have now adjusted their rates to no less than 3%, according to online advertisements.
Major banks such as Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. will also implement the 3% floor rate starting in April, according to ads. These rates were as high as 10% about two years ago.
It remains unclear whether banks received guidance from regulators to make the shift. The record-low loan rates risk further squeezing the sector’s net interest margin, which hit rock bottom of 1.52% at end of last year. Banks have been urged to expand the issuance of personal consumer loans while ensuring reasonable terms including credit limits and interest rates.
Jacqueline Rong, chief China economist at BNP Paribas, said authorities might have instructed the banks to lift consumer loan rates. “We think regulators aim to promote the fair pricing of credit risk, given the non-performing loan ratio of consumer loans have been picking up.”
The spread between consumer loans and outstanding mortgage rates might also encourage some borrowers to use cheaper consumer credit to prepay mortgages, she said, further hurting banks’ net interest income.
The consumer loan rate price war means lenders will have to snatch existing consumer loan borrowers from their peers amid an unhealthy competition, bank officials familiar with the matter said earlier, adding the effectiveness in boosting consumption remains to be seen.
Beijing is seeking to ignite consumer spending and stoke local demand to help make the long-struggling economy less reliant on trade and exports. Still, boosting consumption has been a challenge since the end of the pandemic. Retail sales have been anemic, while consumer prices fell into deflation in February for the first time in over a year.

"Delhi collected  ₹5,000 crore tax from liquor sales, but milk generated less than  ₹200 crore GST: Govt data",https://www.livemint.com/economy/delhi-liquor-policy-delhi-collected-rs-5000-crore-tax-from-liquor-sales-milk-generated-less-than-rs-200-crore-gst-govt-11743301842147.html,"Delhi collected over₹5,000 crore taxes from liquor sales during the ongoing financial year, the newly-elected BJP government told the Assembly. The national capital also sold nearly 6 lakh litres of alcohol per day during 2023-24, the government informed.
The government was responding to a question asked by BJP MLA Abhay Verma, according to a report by NDTV. Here is what it said.
In its reply to Verma, theDelhi governmentsaid that it had earned a revenue of₹5,068.92 crore from excise duty and VAT (value added tax) from liquor sales in Delhi during the financial year 2024-25. This revenue was generated till February 2025.
The new Delhi government, led by the BJP and Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, reported that the erstwhile Arvind Kejriwal government earned₹5,164 crore in taxes onDelhi liquor salesin FY2023-24. Meanwhile, a revenue of₹5,547 crore was generated from liquor sales in FY2022-23 and₹5,487 crore in FY2021-22.
The revelation of the data on liquor sales in Delhi comes at a time when the BJP is repeatedly criticising the Aam Aadmi Party government over the alleged liquor policy scam. AAP supremo and former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal was jailed in connection with the alleged scam, along with his deputy Manish Sisodia. Both leaders were granted bail later.
However, the Delhi liquor policy scam played a pivotal role in Delhi Assembly election 2025 and was instrumental in paving the way for the BJP to win the polls.
The new Rekha Gupta-led Delhi government told the House that only private shops were permitted to sell alcohol in Delhi under AAP's new liquor policy that was implemented from November 2021 to August 2022. Following the scrapping of the policy in September 2022 and the return of the old liquor policy, government liquor stores were permitted to operate.
In 2023-24, Delhi sold 21.27 crore litres of alcohol. This translates to alcohol sales of 5.82 lakh litres per day. In contrast, 25.84 crore litres of alcohol was sold in the national capital in 2022-23.
In sharp contrast,milkand milk products contributed to a revenue of just₹210 in FY25 despite being a widely consumed commodity in Delhi.
The government told the Assembly that it had earned a total tax of₹209.9 crore from GST (goods and services tax) from the sales of milk and milk products in the current financial year till February.
This was a decline in tax collection from FY24, when the government earned about₹300 crore from the sale of milk in 2023-24. The figure was around₹365 crore in 2022-23.

The US is on an egg hunt in Europe to ease prices at home,https://www.livemint.com/economy/the-us-is-on-an-egg-hunt-in-europe-to-ease-prices-at-home-11743175822248.html,"SCHOENEICHE, Germany — The U.S. government is on a global egg hunt, seeking exports from countries in Europe and elsewhere to ease a severe shortage that has caused egg prices at grocery stores to hit record highs.
Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden are among the nations the U.S. Department of Agriculture approached to address the shortage brought on by a bird flu outbreak, according to European industry groups.
But supplying Americans with eggs would be complicated for foreign producers — and not because of political tensions over the myriad import tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed or threatened to impose on his nation's top trading partners.
Even if they were eager to share, European countries don’t have many surplus eggs because of their own avian flu outbreaks and the growing domestic demand ahead of Easter.
One of the biggest obstacles, however, is the approach the United States takes to preventing salmonella contamination. U.S. food safety regulations require fresh eggs to be sanitized and refrigerated before they reach shoppers; in the European Union, safety standards call for Grade A eggs to be sold unwashed and without extended chilling.
“These are two systems that could not be more different,” said Hans-Peter Goldnick, the president of the German Egg Association.Feathers on eggs at the supermarket
It is common in parts of Europe, for example, for consumers to buy eggs that still have feathers and chicken poop stuck to them.
Farmer David Karlsch described the simple process that gets eggs from hens to customers of the family-owned Saballus poultry farm in Schoeneiche, a town just outside Germany’s capital: The eggs are taken from nests, placed into cartons and sold on the premises or from a refrigerated vending machine just outside the property.
“The demand at Easter time is of course very, very high, as many children naturally want to paint eggs,” Karlsch said.
Poland, a major egg exporter, fielded a U.S. query about the availability of eggs, according to Katarzyna Gawrońska, director of the National Chamber of Poultry and Feed Producers. The issue of washed vs. unwashed was a crucial factor as European officials considered such requests, she said.
Eggs are not cleaned in most of the 27 EU nations because of concerns that removing the natural protective coating from eggshells makes them more vulnerable to bacteria, Gawrońska said.
Polish veterinary officials are trying to determine if the country and its farmers can meet U.S. requirements, such as whether the exporting nation has a comparable food safety inspection system or a significant bird flu outbreak.Powdered egg products
Although European Union regulations state that table eggs “shall not be washed or cleaned,” member countries have some leeway if they authorized egg baths at packing plants decades ago.
Danish Egg Association CEO Jørgen Nyberg Larsen said national customs are part of it; washed eggs are the norm in Sweden, for example. But Sweden and Norway have informed the U.S. they don't have extra eggs to export, Larsen said.
For now, any increased U.S. egg imports from Europe are more likely to arrive in powdered form or other products that can be shipped frozen or dried, Larsen said.
That's the response Poland's trade association gave U.S. officials. If the U.S. certifies Poland as a source, the organization's members would have a limited number of shell eggs to sell but could supply “very large volumes of egg processing products,” Gawrońska said.
Processed eggs usually are pasteurized to prevent foodborne illnesses and then used in food manufacturing or by restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Baked goods, pasta and sauces like mayonnaise are some of the commercial products made with egg powder.Europe's own production problems
U.S. officials also tried to sound out farmers in northern Italy's Veneto region for emergency egg supplies, according to Coldiretti, the main Italian agricultural lobbying organization.
But Italy only produces enough eggs to cover the national demand so most of the region's producers said they could not help. Bird flu outbreaks since the start of last year also have taken a toll on the Italian poultry industry.
Germany cannot contribute much either. Its domestic poultry industry generates about 73% of the eggs consumed in the country, “and we ourselves essentially have to import eggs from Holland every day to keep everyone satisfied,"" the German Egg Association’s Goldnick said.
“We have around 45 million eggs that we can collect from the chicken coops every day, and in America, there’s a shortage of around 50 million eggs a day. That shows how difficult it is,” he said.An improving US market and Easter demand
Other countries the U.S. government contacted include Austria, Norway, Spain and Denmark. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it secured new egg commitments from South Korea and Turkey in recent months, although it did not specify the amount or type.
Brazil, which traditionally exports less than 1% of its total egg production, increased its February shipments to the U.S. by 93% compared to a year earlier, according to the Brazilian Association of Animal Protein.
The detection of Newcastle disease, a viral condition often fatal to chickens, in some parts of Brazil impedes the South American nation's ability to become a significant U.S. egg supplier, market insiders say.
Imports of liquid, frozen and dried eggs may help free up some domestic shell eggs for consumers, but the U.S. made its appeal for foreign eggs amid a significant deficit; last month, the country produced 720 million fewer table eggs than in February 2024, a decline of nearly 10%.
The U.S. also cut its own egg exports to boost supplies at home, the Agriculture Department said.
While the informal trade talks continue, the U.S. market has shown signs of improvement. It’s been nearly a month since a major bird flu outbreak impacted egg-laying hens, the department said. It reported the national wholesale price for large eggs dropped to $3.27 per dozen as of March 21, or less than half its peak of $8.15 per dozen on Feb. 21.
U.S. consumers are just starting to see those falling wholesale prices translate to lower prices on grocery shelves, the department said. The big demand for eggs that usually accompanies Easter and Passover could cause prices to edge up again next month.Business is business
Trump hasn't exactly walked on eggshells with the people of Europe since starting his second term. The president's repeated threats to seize Greenland, a Danish territory, infuriated many in Denmark. His posture toward Ukraine and disparaging remarks from top members of his administration have alarmed America's European allies.
The European Union, which is the third-largest trade partner of the U.S., was not exempted from the tariffs Trump ordered on steel, aluminum and automobiles. Bracing for more, it has prepared counter-tariffs on American products.
But many officials in Europe say none of that would rule out exporting eggs.
Goldnick said an egg producer friend recently told him that “if the price is right, then I’ll deliver.” Any deals made or not would come down to business decisions, he said.
“I have two souls in my chest. On the one hand, I would say, 'No, we can’t support this system,' but that’s not the right answer,"" he said, referring to new U.S. tariffs on European goods.
“The right answer is we have to help where we can, Goldnick continued. ""It doesn’t concern the government. You wouldn’t prop them up or anything, but it’s just people’s demand at Easter, for eggs, and that’s just as important to satisfy in America as it is here.”
Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland. Pietro De Cristofaro in Schoeneiche, Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit, Giada Zampano in Rome, Mauricio Savarese in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this report.

What does Donald Trump’s tariff war mean for India-US Trade? Is there room for negotiation? We take a look…,https://www.livemint.com/economy/donald-trump-tariff-trade-war-what-does-mean-for-india-us-is-there-room-for-negotiation-news-economy-imports-explained-11743647209545.html,"Trump Tariff War:United States PresidentDonald Trumphas unveiled a comprehensive tariff policy, imposing at least a 10 per cent duty on nearly all goods entering the US. The White House said this was aimed at correcting trade imbalances and bolstering American industries.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump justified the move by citing “horrendous imbalances” in thetradesector that he claimed have weakened the country's “industrial base” and posed national security risks.
A total of 180 countries were hit by sweeping reciprocal tariffs on April 2, which Donald Trump called “Liberation Day”.
For India in particular, he announced a 26 per cent reciprocal tariff—half the rate India imposes on US imports—which is expected to impact trade between the two countries.
Notably, the 25 per cent tariff on automobile imports is also expected to hit Indian auto companies such as Tata Motors.
Indian exports to the US in FY24 reached $77.5 billion, with the latter being our biggest destination (over 18 per cent of total value) for merchandise goods, according to aHindustan Timesreport. Notably, India'simportsfrom the US dropped to $42.2 billion in the same period, down 17 per cent, theHTreport added.
It is this “imbalance” in trade that Donald Trump has taken aim at.
Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal toldLivemintthat India’s top exported items to the US are electronics (15.6 per cent of total exports to the US), gems and jewellery (11.5 per cent), pharma products (11 per cent), machinery for nuclear reactors (8.1 per cent) and refined petroleum products (5.5 per cent).
So, what is likely to happen?Global Trade Research Initiative co-founder Ajay Srivastava toldHTthat India should wait for a list of demands from the US before responding.
Notably, for its military and oil purchases, India has been diversifying from the US to buying fromRussiaand the United Arab Emirates (UAE), whose prices are much lower in comparison. Thus, choosing the US would require a significant reduction in costs.
Srivastava told the publication that theUSshould consider overall economic relations and not simply trade deficit before making ultimatums. He highlighted that India is an important market for US companies across sectors.
Notably, some experts speaking toLivemintfelt that since Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs at only half the rate other countries impose on US products, there is “room for negotiation rather than retaliation”.

"India to become world’s third-largest economy by 2028, GDP growth projected to hit $5.7 trillion: Morgan Stanley",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-to-become-worlds-third-largest-economy-by-2028-gdp-growth-projected-to-hit-5-7-trillion-morgan-stanley-11741874834090.html,"India is projected to become the world's third-largest economy by 2028, with its economic growth set to hit $5.7 trillion in the next three years. According toMorgan Stanley, by 2028, India will become the world's most sought-after consumer market with a higher share in global output, driven by macro stability-influenced policy and better infrastructure.
From a $3.5 trillion economy in 2023, theIndian economyis projected to expand to $4.7 trillion in 2026, making it the fourth largest in the world behind the US, China, and Germany. In 2028, India will overtake Germany as its economy expands to $5.7 trillion. According to Morgan Stanley, India was the 12th largest economy in the world in 1990, but it slipped to the 13th position in 2000 before rising to the ninth rank in 2020 and fifth in 2023.

India's share of the world's GDP is projected to rise from 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent in 2029. The report projects three scenarios for India's growth: Bear, where the economy expands to $6.6 trillion by 2035 from $3.65 trillion in 2025; Base, where it grows to $8.8 trillion; and Bull, where the size balloons to $10.3 trillion.
It sawGDP per capitarise from $2,514 in 2025 to $4,247 in the Bear scenario in 2035, $5,683 under the Base scenario, and $6,706 under the Bull scenario. Regarding present times, Morgan Stanley said growth is likely recovering.
""India is likely gaining share in global output in the coming decades driven by strong foundational factors, including robust population growth, a functioning democracy, macro stability influenced policy, better infrastructure, a rising entrepreneurial class and improving social outcomes.""
“The implication is that India will be the world's most sought-after consumer market, it will undergo a major energy transition, credit to GDP will rise, and manufacturing could gain share in GDP,” said Morgan Stanley in its report.
“High-frequency indicators weremixed in recent weeks but are distinctly betterthan a few months ago. We expect growth to recover after a 2H24 (second half of 2024) slowdown on fiscal and monetary policy support, with recovery in service exports.” The global brokerage expected India's GDP to be 6.3 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 31 and 6.5 per cent next.

“Macro-stability should remain in the comfort range, providing flexibility to policymakers,"" said the report. Going forward, the country's consumption recovery is expected to be broad-based as the income tax cuts propel urban demand, supporting the buoyant trend in rural consumption.
Within investments, public and household capex drove growth, while privatecorporate capex recovered gradually. The strength in services exports bodes well for the labour market outlook, with moderating inflation likely to improve purchasing power. Domestic demand may emerge as the key driver of growth, bolstered by policy support on the monetary and fiscal front.
Headline CPI has cooled off from its near-term peak to track close to four per cent, driven by moderating food prices while core inflation continues to remain well-behaved. The outlook for headline inflation hinges on food prices (46 per cent of the CPI basket), which is expected to soften in the coming months.

Morgan Stanley expected inflation to be 4.3 per cent year-on-year in FY2026-27, lower than 4.9 per cent in FY2025. On the monetary policy front, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is easing across all its levers -- rates, liquidity and regulations. It embarked on a rate easing cycle in the February policy, and Morgan Stanley expected another 25 bps rate cut in April.
On the fiscal side, theBudget aims to reinforce growth recovery by spurring consumption (through income tax cuts)and spending mix in favour of capex while keeping macro stability in check by maintaining fiscal prudence.
Stating that risks to growth stem from external factors, it said, ""We closely monitor developments on trade and tariff policies by the US government, alongside the strength in the dollar, US Fed's reaction function and global growth and financial conditions.
On the domestic side, we track fiscal profligacy at the state level and/or any change in policy mix that would weigh on macro stability"". The most crucial cue will likely be global, including US policy and global growth rates. ""A global recession or a near recession will challenge our call and keep the Indian equities off highs in 2025,"" it added.

"China, Japan, S. Korea Renew Free-Trade Call, Vow to Build Ties",https://www.livemint.com/economy/china-japan-s-korea-renew-free-trade-call-vow-to-build-ties-11743307658891.html,"Trade chiefs from China, Japan and South Korea renewed their call for an open, fair flow of goods and pledged to deepen economic ties, a few days before the Trump administration is set to unleash fresh tariffs on nations around the world.
South Korea’s Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun and his counterparts, Yoji Muto of Japan and China’s Wang Wentao, discussed a free trade agreement in Seoul on Sunday. While they didn’t signal significant progress toward a pact, the gathering demonstrated increasing willingness among the three countries to strengthen ties as they face the impact of US tariffs.
“We especially recognized the need for ongoing trilateral economic and trade cooperation to effectively address emerging challenges and achieve tangible outcomes in key areas,” the ministers said in a joint statement.
The meeting took place with the US’ 25% levy on car imports set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Washington time on April 3. Both South Korea and Japan are major exporters of vehicles to America.
President Donald Trump is also expected to announce so-called reciprocal tariffs, potentially affecting sectors including semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Any impact to chip sales would be particularly damaging for South Korea, given they remain a key driver of growth for the export-reliant nation.
The three Asian countries are among those targeted by Trump. While China is in the middle of a renewed trade war with the US, Washington’s broader use of tariffs shows even American allies including Japan and South Korea are not immune to the threats.
The nations’ latest meeting is in line with the message China has been sending, that it is open for business — contrasting with the US’ more protectionist “America First” policies.
On Friday, President Xi Jinping met with a group of global business leaders in Beijing in an effort to boost investor sentiment as rising tariffs fuel uncertainty for the economy and international trade. The meeting was attended by Wang and executives including Samsung Electronics Co.’s Jay Y. Lee and SK Hynix Inc. Chief Executive Officer Kwak Noh-jung, both South Korean companies.
The three ministers also pledged to strengthen the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a framework that aims to streamline supply chains and enhance trade and investment among the largest economies in Asia including China, Japan and South Korea. The US is not part of the pact.
The US car tariffs have prompted Japan to consider measures to protect local jobs, while South Korea said it will come up with emergency steps to help its automakers. China has implemented retaliatory levies against the US while Beijing tries to stabilize ties with its major trading partners.
The gathering of the trade chiefs followed a recent meeting of the countries’ top diplomats in Tokyo. Japan is scheduled to host the three nations’ next summit of their leaders.

Govt confident of meeting 277 GW peak power demand in FY26: Shripad Naik,https://www.livemint.com/economy/govt-confident-of-meeting-277-gw-peak-power-demand-in-fy26-shripad-naik-11743070156132.html,"New Delhi, Mar 27 (PTI) The government has taken several steps to meet the 277 GW peak power demand anticipated in 2025-26, Parliament was informed on Thursday.
The All India Peak Demand for 2024-25 (till February) was 2,49,856 MW, which occurred on May 30, 2024, Minister of State for Power Shripad Naik said in a reply to the Lok Sabha.
This peak demand was successfully met with only a marginal gap of 2 MW, he said.
In the 2025-26 fiscal year, Naik said a peak demand of 277 GW is expected as per the mid-term review of the 20th Electric Power Survey.
""The country is confident to meet this projected demand with optimal usage of existing and under construction capacities,"" he said.
Besides, all GENCOs (power generation companies), including independent power producers (IPPs) and central generating stations, have been advised to generate and maintain full availability on daily basis excluding the period of planned maintenance or forced outage.
Planned maintenance of generating units is being minimised during the high demand period.
Steady supply of coal to all thermal power plants is being ensured to prevent fuel shortages.
Directions under Section 11 of the Electricity Act have been issued to imported coal-based plants to operate and generate power to their full capacity.
Gas-based power plants of NTPC as well as other generators are being scheduled during high-power demand period.
The Centre in November 2023 has proposed setting up of an additional minimum 80,000 MW coal-based thermal capacity by 2031-32.
Against this target, a total coal-based capacity of 9,350 MW has already been commissioned in 2023-24 and 2024-25 and currently, 29,900 MW of thermal capacity is under construction.
In 2024-25, contracts for 22,640 MW thermal capacity have been awarded, of which, 5,600 MW thermal capacity is now under construction.

"CEA Nageswaran warns of global growth risks, backs deregulation to spur economy",https://www.livemint.com/economy/ease-of-doing-business-deregulation-indian-economy-global-growth-cea-v-anantha-nageswaran-modi-sitharaman-11741079912741.html,"India’s chief economic advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran on Tuesday warned that recent policy actions across the world could hinder global growth and emphasized the need to foster optimism in India by easing economic activity.
Speaking at a post-budget webinar organized by the department of financial services, he said economic activity with minimal compliance, inspection, and licensing requirements will foster optimism about growth.
""The budget announced by the honourable finance minister, under the guidance of the honourable prime minister, places a high degree of emphasis on deregulation and ease of doing business,"" he said, adding the budget 2025 focussed on three critical reforms: strengthening investment climate and ease of doing business, enhancing regulatory efficiency and financial stability.
The Economic Survey 2024-25, presented by Nageswaran on 31 January, a day before the Union Budget 2025-26, recommends freeing up enterprises, especially small and medium businesses, highlighting burdensome regulations stifling growth.
To be sure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced plans to establish a deregulation commission to reduce state intervention in governance.
On 4 March,Hindustan Timesreported that the Centre may launch a national deregulation commission by May to propose reforms easing rules, fast-tracking approvals, and removing business barriers.
The report said a task force led by Union cabinet secretary T.V. Somanathan is shaping the proposed commission, which will draft policies for an 'Ease of Doing Business 2.0 plan' to drive growth amid global challenges.
""(An) enormous investment climate is necessary when global FDI flows are likely to be affected, utilizing global risk aversion, investment climate needs to be maintained as that would create capital formation, create jobs and sustain economic growth,"" Nageswaran said.
""A modern, responsive regulatory framework is an indispensable condition, or a prerequisite, to create unfavourable good, conducive investment climate,"" he added.
Nageswaran said India has become one of the world's most attractive investment destinations, as reflected in strong FDI inflows over the years, but cautioned that the country cannot afford to be complacent.
""We need to continue to focus on improving regulatory clarity, easy business operations, and make sure that the plumbing of our regulatory framework corresponds with the broad vision,"" he added.
India saw a rebound in foreign direct investment (FDI) in FY25, with gross inflows rising 17.9% year-on-year to $55.6 billion in the first eight months, up from $47.2 billion in the same period of 2023-24, according to the Economic Survey 2024-25.
Cumulatively, FDI inflows into India have exceeded $1 trillion from April 2000 to September 2024.
Nageswaran emphasized the crucial role of foreign investment in India's economic growth and development, noting that as a current account deficit country, India requires both portfolio and direct investments.
""Over time, many countries, including India, have realized the importance of balancing investor protection with state sovereignty. The goal is to safeguard national interest while encouraging foreign investment,"" he said.
""As with everything, it is a balancing act, and we are prepared to iterate our approach,"" he added.
Nageswaran noted that the global investment landscape and international jurisprudence have evolved significantly, with investors now seeking stronger protections, particularly in emerging markets.
""These developments have led to the decision to revise and update India's model bid to align with international laws while ensuring the country remains an attractive investment destination, especially for medium enterprises from advanced economies,"" he said.
""The new model, therefore, will be more attuned to the demands of a dynamic global investment environment,"" he added.
Nageswaran said India is revising its model Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) after a decade to align with evolving global investment trends and investor demands for stronger protections as countries worldwide update their frameworks to address modern challenges.
""The new model BIT, therefore, will be more attuned to the demands of a dynamic global investment environment. At the same time, we will reflect India's sovereign rights and the importance of regulatory space so that public policy priorities are not constrained by international legal obligations,"" he added.

India will navigate through the tariff challenges: Bernstein,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-will-navigate-through-the-tariff-challenges-bernstein-11743660973901.html,"New Delhi [India], April 3 (ANI): India will be able to safely navigate through the tariff challenges, says a report by Bernstein, an international equity research company.
The report stated that India is more likely to engage with the US through negotiations rather than escalating a trade war. While there could be an immediate negative sentiment in the markets, the report expects a macroeconomic recovery in the second half of the year.
It said ""We believe India will be able to safely navigate through the tariff challenges and is more likely to engage with US through negotiations rather than heating up the trade war"".
India had already taken proactive steps before the tariff announcement. In March, India signed the Terms of Reference for a Bilateral Trade Agreement after a priority intervention from the Prime Minister's Office. This move has now set the stage for final negotiations between the two countries.
Additionally, India had earlier reduced import duties on certain American products, including high-end motorcycles, agricultural products, and Bourbon whiskey, as part of its budget announcements.
The report sees a potential trade agreement with the US as a positive long-term development. However, some sectors may face risks due to the weakening of the US economy, dipping into a possible recession.
In response to the recession, the report has upgraded the healthcare sector to equal weight, as it is expected to have a limited impact, while the IT sector has been downgraded to equal weight due to the rising risk of a US recession.
The US administration has also included non-monetary barriers while calculating tariffs. If this includes the Value Added Tax (VAT), which the White House recently mentioned, it could be seen as an unusual measure, given that domestic sales tax applies to both imports and local products.
However, compared to other nations facing tariffs from the US, India ranks on the lower end, with its tariffs being lower than those of Vietnam (46 per cent) and China (34 per cent). Other Southeast Asian countries, which compete with India in trade, also face higher tariffs.
Despite the short-term negative sentiment, the report believes that India is relatively shielded from long-term impacts. A major reason for this is the nature of India's export basket. IT services, which make up a significant portion of exports, are outside the scope of goods-specific tariffs.
Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical sector, another key export area, has limited alternatives, is not discretionary, and falls under exempted categories. While IT could be affected by a long-term slowdown in the US economy and the rise of artificial intelligence, the impact is not directly linked to tariffs.
Overall, the report suggests that India's strategic engagement and proactive policy measures will help it navigate through the current tariff challenges, ensuring stability in the long run. (ANI)

"LPG gas prices to rise by  ₹50 per cylinder from tomorrow — April 8, 2025",https://www.livemint.com/economy/lpg-prices-to-rise-by-rs-50-from-tomorrow-morning-delhi-mumbai-berngaluru-chennai-kolkata-april-8-11744022919786.html,"Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) prices will increase by₹50 per cylinder starting tomorrow morning, Tuesday, April 8, 2025, ANI reported, quoting India's Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.LPG priceswill increase from₹500 to₹550 for PMUY beneficiaries and from₹803 to₹853 for others.
Addressing a press conference the Oil Minister said, “The price per cylinder ofLPGwill increase by₹50. From 500, it will go up to 550 (for PMUY beneficiaries) and for others, it will go up from₹803 to₹853,” said Minister Puri, noting that the Ministry will review this step as the price hike goes along.
The Indian government, through the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), aims to provide clean cooking fuel, specifically LPG, to women from Below-Poverty-Line (BPL) households in rural India.
#WATCH| Delhi | Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri says, ’This₹50 increase per cylinder will be for the Ujjwala beneficiary and overall for the non-Ujjwala beneficiary as well.

According to the official announcement, the government also increased the excise duty onpetrol and dieselby₹2 each.
According toMint'sreport on April 7, the excise duty on petrol and diesel prices will increase to₹13 and₹10, respectively, effective April 8, as per the ministry notification.
On Monday, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas clarified that customers buying fossil fuels will not be affected by this rise in excise duty, and this move is aimed at the company to compensate for the losses.
“Therefore, theexcise dutythat you have seen increase is not to go on to the consumer on petrol and diesel. That excise increase is intended to compensate the oil marketing companies for₹43,000 crore that they have incurred as a loss on the gas part of it,” said Puri in the press address.
The increased excise duty is expected to be adjusted against the reduction in petrol and diesel prices that was warranted because of a fall in international oil prices, reported the news agencyPTIearlier citing experts. This serves as the reason why the customer will not face the rise in the price of petrol and diesel, as per the report.
“Let me clarify upfront on the record, this will not be passed on to the consumer...The international price of crude came down to around $60 a barrel, but please remember that our oil marketing companies carry inventories over a 45-day period,” said Puri in a press briefing on Monday.

"Tamil Nadu achieves record 9.69% economic growth, leading India’s states in 2024-25",https://www.livemint.com/economy/tamil-nadu-achieves-record-9-69-economic-growth-leading-india-s-states-in-202425-11743855370307.html,"Tamil Nadu ranked the highest amongst other Indian states in terms of real economic growth rate, which stood at 9.69 per cent for the financial year 2024-25, reported the news portalThe Hinduon April 5, 2025.
The realeconomic growthrate for the Southern state was the highest in the last 10 years, as per the report.
Tamil Nadu's gross domestic product (GDP) value for the financial year 2024-25 rose to₹17,23,698 or₹17.23 lakh crore, compared to₹15,71,368 or₹15.71 crore in the 2023-24 fiscal, according to the MoSPI (Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation) data cited in the news report.
Tamil Nadu's previous real economic growth rate high was at 8.59 per cent in the year 2017-18, while the all-time low was during the COVID-19 global pandemic at 0.07 per cent.
As per the news report, Tamil Nadu was one of the few states that recorded positive growth during the COVID pandemic, whereas many other states recorded a negative growth rate.
The report also highlighted that Tamil Nadu's nominal growth rate was at 14.02 per cent for the year, also the highest among other Indian states. The real economic growth rates show the growth of a State or a nation excluding inflation.
However, there were some states likeGujarat, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh, among 14 other States and Union Territories whos growth rate data was not uploaded to the Ministry website.
The economic survey for the state projected the growth to be more than 8 per cent. Another projection for Tamil Nadhu's growth was from the working paper from the Madras School of Economics (MSE) which estimated the growth to be at 9.3 per cent.
The data shows that the actual growth rate has successfully managed to beat both the economic expectations to deliver more returns and show the condition of the State.
According to the news portal's report,Tamil Nadu's economic growth has been driven by the services (tertiary) and the secondary sector, which involves professional services, communications, along with manufacturing and construction segments.
In the Tertiary or services sector, professional services have contributed by logging 13.6 per cent growth, followed by communications at 13 per cent growth. Other segments like trade, repair, hotels, and restaurants have contributed 11.7 per cent to the State's economic health.
On the secondary sector front, manufacturing and construction have grown 8 per cent and 10.6 per cent respectively which helped the State achieve this new record growth.
“If all sectors grow 0.5 percentage point higher than what they did in 2024-25, the State’s growth will be around 10.7% in 2025-26,” Dr. Shanmugam, the former director of MSE told the news portal.

Fruit exports from India grow 47 per cent in 5 years: Govt in RS,https://www.livemint.com/economy/fruit-exports-from-india-grow-47-per-cent-in-5-years-govt-in-rs-11743169279661.html,"New Delhi, Mar 28 (PTI) There has been a 47.5 per cent increase in exports of fruits from India in the last five years, the government on Friday informed the Rajya Sabha.
Replying to supplementaries during question hour, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Jitin Prasada said the free trade agreements with the UAE and Australia have also helped increase exports of fruits to the UAE and Australia by 27 per cent and six per cent, respectively.
""As far as fruits export goes, there has been increase of 47.5 per cent in the last five years. Major fruits exported from India are mangoes, grapes, bananas, apple, pineapple, pomegranate and watermelon.
""I can assure you that the government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that our fruits and food supply through exports is ensured,"" he said in the Rajya Sabha.
The minister assured the members that the government is doing everything to ensure the quality of our products and fruits are of international standards, and pesticide level is very low.
""Because, any product that goes from India is brand India and the name of India and no stone has been left unturned to ensure the quality of our products and fruits sent abroad,"" he said.
Prasada said utmost care is being taken to ensure quality and minimum residual limits as far as pesticides is concerned. There are a lot of challenges in this field. But, a lot of improvement and supply chain gaps has been filled up, he noted.
""We are exploring new markets for fruit exports. The free trade agreement has helped increase exports to UAE, where there has been a 27 per cent increase in fruits export and with Australia where there has been a 6 per cent increase in export of fruits,"" he said.
In his written reply to a starred question, Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal said among the major measures taken by the Department of Commerce, through APEDA, at the state level, in collaboration with respective state governments, for supporting the fresh fruits trade include development of post-harvest handling facilities and developing cold chain network in the form of integrated pack houses, reefer vehicles and in-house testing facilities to maintain quality and longevity of fruits and treatment facilities like Vapour Heat Treatment (VHT), Hot Water Treatment (HWT) etc. to mitigate the infestation/incidence of pests in specific fruits.
Besides, participation of exporters, FPOs in international trade fairs including the events exclusively organised for trade in fruits such as Asia Fruit Logistica (Hong Kong), MACFRUIT Italy etc. and organising international buyer-seller meets in states for promotion of agri exports including for fruits and carrying out campaigns for promotion and branding of Indian fruits in key international markets during prominent trade fairs.
""India currently exports fresh fruits to more than 85 countries. APEDA works in close collaboration with the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer's Welfare for entering new markets like Australia, Europe, USA and emerging markets. Intensive discussions are ongoing at the level of NPPO India and its counterpart agencies for gaining market access for India's fresh fruits in new markets.
""In the last three years, market access was achieved for the following fresh fruits in the following countries: (i) fresh banana in Canada; (ii) pomegranate arils in Australia, USA, Serbia, and New Zealand; (iii) whole pomegranates in Australia via irradiation treatment,"" the minister said.
""As a result of government's intensive export promotion measures for fresh fruits, India's exports of fresh fruits in the period 2019-20 to 2023-24 have grown by 47 per cent in value terms from USD 668.7 million to USD 986.3 million and have grown by 69 per cent in terms of quantity from 7.55 lakh MT to 12.76 Lakh MT,"" he said.
""The government is focusing on development of the sea protocols for perishable products particularly fresh fruits which will enable export of higher volumes particularly to long distance markets at more competitive prices enabling higher realisations to all stakeholders in the export supply chain including farmers.
""Department of Commerce through APEDA is getting these protocols developed through the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Sea protocols have been developed for bananas and pomegranates and are under development for mangoes, oranges and pineapples,"" the minister also said.

Korea’s New FX Rules Renew Calls for More Fundamental Changes,https://www.livemint.com/economy/koreas-new-fx-rules-renew-calls-for-more-fundamental-changes-11741674018152.html,"South Korea’s new measures to boost foreign currency inflows are tinker-at-the-margins tweaks that will breed short-term stability while exposing the need for more fundamental policy changes, analysts say.
Among the rules introduced Sunday to boost investor interest include raising FX derivatives’ hedging limits, allowing domestic institutions to buy foreign currency-denominated “Kimchi” bonds, and streamlining foreigners’ tax paperwork.
They come at a time when Koreans are losing confidence in local markets and increasingly investing abroad, while foreign investors’ demand also remains tepid. Koreans’ investment position abroad hit a record $1.1 trillion in 2024 on a net basis, Bank of Korea data shows. Authorities’ latest initiatives reflect their urgency to reverse some of the trends.
“The measure could provide a psychological safety net for market participants and contribute to market stability,” said Chanhee Kim, senior analyst at Shinhan Securities. “But it won’t change the direction of the flow itself.”
In previewing the changes, the Finance Ministry said in a statement last week that the measures were being prepared to address an “imbalance” in local foreign currency supply and demand.
The won was Asia’s worst performing currency in 2024, shedding more than 12% against the dollar. With foreigners cutting stock holdings, the benchmark index Kospi also fell 9.6% for the year.
The measures have incentives to woo foreigners, but some are meant to nudge Koreans to think harder about investing locally, particularly in stocks. One change raises the proportion for local stocks in an individual savings account vehicle. Another enables exporters to borrow money from banks in foreign currency to use in domestic facilities.
The changes may not improve the imbalance cited by the government, said Min Gyeong-won, an economist at Woori Bank in Seoul, citing a need for better industrial and corporate support policies to attract more foreign investments.
Moon Hong-Cheol, a fixed-income and FX strategist at DB Financial Investment, echoed the sentiment. The measures to counter the won’s weakening will have limited impact without changes in the “fundamental economic structure,” he said.

India’s manufacturing growth hits 8-month high in March—but export gains lag,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-manufacturing-growth-india-pmi-march-2025-hsbc-india-manufacturing-pmi-india-factory-output-growth-gdp-india-11743571893013.html,"India’s manufacturing sector expanded at its fastest pace in eight months in March, driven by strong demand and a sharp rise in output, according to a private survey released Wednesday.
The HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by S&P Global, rose to 58.1 in March from 56.3 in February and 57.7 in January. The index was 56.4 in December and 56.5 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.

""The latest reading showed a substantial improvement in the health of the (manufacturing) sector that was above its long-run average,"" the survey said. “March saw total sales expand to the greatest extent since July 2024, with companies remarking on positive customer interest, favourable demand conditions and successful marketing initiatives.”
Despite strong domestic demand, manufacturing export growth slowed to a three-month low, though gains were recorded in Asia, Europe, and West Asia.
""India registered a 58.1manufacturing PMIin March, up substantially from 56.3 during the previous month. Although international orders slightly slowed, overall demand momentum remained robust, and the new orders index recorded an eight-month high of 61.5,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.

Rising demand led firms to dip into inventories, causing the fastest drop in finished goods stocks in over three years. Business sentiment remained upbeat, with about 30% of firms expecting higher output over the next year, compared to less than 2% anticipating a decline, Bhandari added.
India’seconomic growthrebounded in theDecember quarterafter a slowdown in September but remained below the previous fiscal year’s pace. GDP grew 6.2% in Q3 FY25—the slowest since Q4 FY23, except for Q2 FY25’s revised estimate of 5.6%.
For FY25, GDP growth is projected at 6.5% by the National Statistics Office (NSO). A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests GDP growth will have to average 7.6% in the final quarter of the year to align with the NSO's second advanced estimate.
Manufacturing output rose 3.5% in Q3FY25, up from 2.1% in the prior quarter but significantly below the 14% and 7.5% recorded in Q4FY24 and Q1FY25, respectively. Its sluggish growth weighed on overall GDP expansion.

India’s trade momentum remains strong despite global challenges: Unctad,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-trade-momentum-disputes-global-challenges-unctad-report-goods-growth-us-china-11742731547888.html,"New Delhi: India’s trade performance remained strong in 2024, defying global economic uncertainties, with exports growing 6.3% for the calendar year, significantly outpacing global trade growth of 3.7%, according to the latest report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad).
India, alongside the US and China, played a key role in driving global trade, which saw an overall increase of nearly $1.2 trillion, as per the report. While trade in goods recorded a modest growth, services led the surge, contributing $700 billion to the global trade expansion, compared to $500 billion from goods.

India’s total exports of goods and services reached a record $817.4 billion in calendar year 2024 (CY24), up from $769 billion in CY23, marking a significant leap in the country’s external trade performance. The first three quarters of the 2024-25 financial year witnessed record-breaking exports, with the third quarter achieving the highest-ever export levels.
Despite persistent global challenges such as supply chain disruptions and economic slowdowns in key markets, India’s trade resilience remains evident. The steady growth in both goods and services exports highlights the country's strengthening position in global trade and its adaptability to evolving economic conditions.
As per the Unctad report, trade remains stable in early 2025, yet mounting geoeconomic tensions, protectionist policies and trade disputes signal likely disruptions ahead.

Global trade imbalances widened in 2024, nearing levels last seen in 2022, according to trade data trends. The US continued to register the largest trade deficit, while China maintained the highest trade surplus, with both trends intensifying throughout the year.
Among other major economies, the European Union recorded a notable trade surplus in 2024, reversing its earlier deficits, largely driven by high energy prices. Meanwhile, India, Japan and the UK remained among the economies with significant trade deficits. The shifting trade patterns reflect evolving global economic conditions, including supply chain adjustments, fluctuating commodity prices and policy shifts in key markets.
In October 2024, the World Trade Organization (WTO) adjusted its projection for global merchandise trade volume growth in 2024 to 2.7%, a slight increase from the previous estimate of 2.6%. However, the forecast for 2025 was revised downward from 3.3% to 3.0%, indicating tempered expectations for trade expansion in the coming year. The WTO’s trade projection report for 2025 is slated to be released in mid-April.

Peru Holds Key Rate as Policymakers Gauge Trade War Impact,https://www.livemint.com/economy/peru-holds-key-rate-as-policymakers-gauge-trade-war-impact-11741909851347.html,"Peru left interest rates unchanged on Thursday as policymakers try to gauge the inflationary impact of global trade wars.
The central bank held its key rate at 4.75% on Thursday, as expected by seven out of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The other four expected a quarter percentage point cut to 4.5%.
The central bank noted positive local inflation trends, but said that global economic risks have risen “due to the high uncertainty associated with the impact of restrictive measures to foreign trade.”
“In that context, high volatility in financial markets is being observed,” the bank said in its statement.
Peru has one of the lowest rates of inflation in emerging markets, along with economic growth that is out-pacing regional peers. But authorities have begun to acknowledge that US President Donald Trump’s trade policies could impact Peru, especially if metal and fruit exports are hit with levies.
In February, Peru’s annual inflation slowed to 1.5%, with the central bank restating on Thursday that it expects it to further cool to around 1% this month. The bank forecasts an economic expansion of 3% this year.
Energy and Mines Minister Jorge Montero said this week that Peru is readying a delegation to try to avert tariffs on its copper. Agriculture Minister Angel Manero said it was unlikely the US would target Peruvian crops such as blueberries or grapes, but said the country would appeal to the World Trade Organization if it came to that.

Explainer: Possible impact of Trumps reciprocal tariffs on India,https://www.livemint.com/economy/explainer-possible-impact-of-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-on-india-11743418989011.html,"New Delhi, Mar 31 (PTI) Indian industry and government officials are uncertain whether US President Donald Trump will proceed with his threat to impose reciprocal tariffs on its key trading partners, including India, on April 2.
According to a senior government official, the domestic industry is ""paranoid"" and has been sending communications to the government, seeking protection against the impacts of these tariffs.
Stakeholders are hopeful that America may defer its decision to impose reciprocal tariffs from April 2, as India is one of the few countries with which the US has decided to negotiate a trade agreement.
Here is a list of Q & As (questions and answers) to explain these issues and implications of the US move:
Q: What is the USA's reciprocal trade and tariffs plan
A: The plan allows the US to raise tariffs/import duties on countries with which it has a trade deficit. Trump claims that the US charges low tariffs, while other countries impose higher duties and trade barriers on American goods. This, he says, leads to a USD 1 trillion trade deficit that also harms American industries and workers.
Q: What is the volume of bilateral trade between India and the US?
A: From 2021-22 to 2023-24, the US was the largest trading partner of India. The US accounts for about 18 per cent of India's total goods exports, 6.22 per cent in imports, and 10.73 per cent in bilateral trade.
With India, America has a trade surplus (difference between imports and exports), of USD 35.32 billion in goods in 2023-24. It was USD 27.7 billion in 2022-23, USD 32.85 billion in 2021-22, USD 22.73 billion in 2020-21 and USD 17.26 billion in 2019-20.
Q: What is the quantum of reciprocal tariffs that can be imposed on Indian exports to the US?
A: It is still unclear how the tariffs will be applied - whether at the product level, sector level, or country level.
Q: What are the views of experts on these tariffs?
A: GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava has said the actual import tariffs on US exports to India are significantly lower than often claimed. If the US adopts a fair trade approach, Indian industries can continue exporting to the US with minimal disruptions, fostering a more balanced and stable trade relationship.
He has also said that these tariffs have nothing to do with reciprocity, as trade involves diverse products. For instance, India may be a key exporter of product 'X' to America but the US could be a major exporter of item 'Y'. Similarly, despite having a trade pact with Mexico and Canada (USMCA), the US is imposing additional tariffs on their products.
To assess the potential impact, think tank GTRI has analysed reciprocal tariffs at four levels:
Country level – A uniform tariff on all Indian exports:
If the US imposes a single tariff on all products from India, it would be an additional 4.9 per cent. Currently, US goods face a weighted average tariff of 7.7 per cent in India, while Indian exports to the US attract only 2.8 per cent, leading to a 4.9 per cent difference.
Separate tariffs for agriculture and industry:
If the US chose to impose separate tariffs, the additional tariff for farm products would be 32.4 per cent and on industrial products 3.3 per cent.
Indian farm exports to the US currently face a 5.3 per cent duty, whereas US farm exports to India face a much higher 37.7 per cent, creating a 32.4 per cent gap.
On the other hand, for industrial products, US exports to India face a 5.9 per cent weighted average tariff, while Indian industrial exports to the US face only 2.6 per cent, resulting in a 3.3 per cent gap.
Sector-level tariffs:
At the broad sector level, the potential tariff gaps between India and the US vary across the sectors.
The gap is 8.6 per cent for chemicals and pharmaceuticals, 5.6 per cent for plastics, 1.4 per cent for textiles and clothing, 13.3 per cent for diamonds, gold, and jewellery, 2.5 per cent for iron, steel, and base metals, 5.3 per cent for machinery and computers, 7.2 per cent for electronics, and 23.1 per cent for automobiles and auto components.
The higher the tariff gap, the worse affected a sector will be.
Grouping all products into 30 categories:
India's exports to the US span 30 sectors, with six in agriculture and 24 in industry, each facing different tariff impacts.
Agriculture:
Srivastava said that the hardest-hit sector will be fish, meat, and processed seafood, with USD 2.58 billion in exports facing a 27.83 per cent tariff differential. Shrimp, a major export, will become significantly less competitive.
Processed food, sugar, and cocoa exports worth USD 1.03 billion will also struggle with a 24.99 per cent tariff increase, making Indian snacks and confectionery expensive in the US.
Cereals, vegetables, fruits, and spices, valued at USD 1.91 billion, face a 5.72 per cent tariff differential, impacting rice and spice shipments.
Dairy products worth USD 181.49 million will be severely affected by a 38.23 per cent tariff differential, making ghee, butter, and milk powder costlier, reducing their market share.
Edible oils with USD 199.75 million in exports face a 10.67 per cent tariff, increasing costs for coconut and mustard oil.
Alcohol, wines, and spirits face the highest tariff hike at 122.10 per cent, though exports are only USD 19.20 million.
Live animals and animal products face a 27.75 per cent tariff differential on USD 10.31 million in exports.
Industrial Goods:
The pharmaceutical sector, India's largest industrial export, worth USD 12.72 billion, faces a 10.90 per cent tariff differential, increasing costs for generic medicines and speciality drugs.
Diamonds, gold, and silver with USD 11.88 billion in exports will attract a 13.32 per cent tariff hike, raising jewellery prices and reducing competitiveness.
Electrical, telecom, and electronics exports worth USD 14.39 billion face a 7.24 per cent tariff, affecting iPhones and other communication devices.
Machinery, boiler, turbine, and computer exports valued at USD 7.10 billion will see a 5.29 per cent tariff hike, impacting India's engineering exports.
Chemicals (excluding pharma) worth USD 5.71 billion will be affected by a 6.05 per cent tariff, reducing the US demand for Indian speciality chemicals.
Textiles, fabrics, yarn, and carpets with USD 2.76 billion in exports face a 6.59 per cent tariff, making Indian textiles expensive.
Rubber products, including tyres and belts, worth USD 1.06 billion, will face a 7.76 per cent tariff, while paper and wood articles, worth USD 969.65 million, will have a 7.87 per cent tariff.
Ceramic, glass, and stone products with USD 1.71 billion in exports will face an 8.27 per cent tariff, impacting the demand.
Footwear, with USD 457.66 million in exports, faces a high 15.56 per cent tariff differential.
Minimal or No Impact Sectors:
Some sectors will not face additional tariffs as the US already imposes higher duties.
Ores, minerals, and petroleum worth USD 3.33 billion have a negative tariff differential of - 4.36 per cent, meaning no new tariffs will be applied.
Similarly, garments, with USD 4.93 billion in exports, have a - 4.62 per cent differential, keeping tariffs unchanged.
Q: Is it simple to calculate the impact of these tariffs?
A: Experts say it is not easy, because as indicated, the US may also factor in non-tariff barriers, VAT (GST), and currency impacts in its reciprocal tariff policy.

RBI may cut repo rate by 25 bps in April; total 75 bps reduction likely in FY26: Ind-Ra,https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-may-cut-repo-rate-by-25-bps-in-april-total-75-bps-reduction-likely-in-fy26-indra-11743071315318.html,"New Delhi, Mar 27 (PTI) The RBI's monetary policy committee is expected cut benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points in its policy review meeting next month to push growth, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said on Thursday.
""We expect the headline inflation in FY25 to cool off to 4.7 per cent. Monetary easing may be limited to 75 bps in FY26,"" Ind-Ra Chief Economist and Head Public Finance, Devendra Kumar Pant said.
However, if the impact of US reciprocal tariff turns out to be higher than expected, there may be higher easing by RBI, Ind-Ra said in a statement.
The RBI's monetary policy committee is scheduled to meet 6 times in the next fiscal 2025-26 beginning April 1. The first meeting is slated for April 7-9.
""Ind-Ra expects the monetary policy committee (MPC) to opt in for a 25bps cut in policy rates in its forthcoming April 2025 meeting,"" the rating agency said.
Higher and stubborn inflation had prompted the RBI to tighten the monetary policy, and it raised the policy rate by 250 bps between May 2022 and February 2023, reaching 6.5 per cent.
In February 2025, the repo rate was cut by 25 bps to 6.25 per cent.
Ind-Ra expects the headline retail inflation in March quarter of FY25 to fall below 4 per cent, after a gap of 21 quarters.
It expects RBI to go in for maximum three rate cuts in FY26, aggregating to 75 bps.
""These along with one rate cut in February 2025 would translate in a 100bps cut in the current policy easing with the terminal repo rate at 5.5 per cent and average inflation at around 4 per cent, which would translate in a real repo rate of 1.5 per cent in FY26,"" Ind-Ra said.
The February 2025 MPC minutes suggest that the RBI is cognizant of slowing growth momentum. This suggests that while the low and stable inflation is the prime target of the RBI, the growth support through monetary policy will increasingly be a focus area of monetary policy, Ind-Ra added.

Black Monday 2.0? China braces for ‘ugly’ plunge; Japan looks at ‘available means’- will India take ‘significant’ steps?,https://www.livemint.com/economy/monday-mayhem-china-braces-for-ugly-start-japan-looks-at-available-means-india-to-retaliate-to-tariffs-trump-11743990251624.html,"The world is still reeling from Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which spooked Asian and US stocks, with experts warning of another ‘Black Monday’, reminiscent of the 1987 Wall Street crash. While the baseline charge has kicked in, higher duties on some countries — which replace, rather than add to the 10% rate — are due to start on April 9.
Although China retaliated with 34% tariffs on all US goods, its markets expect a battering Monday, April 7, as trading resumed.
India said it does not plan to retaliate against Donald Trump's 26 per cent tariff on imports, the nation has looked into a clause that offers a possible reprieve for trading partners who “take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements,"" reported PTI.
Japan, South Korea, India, and other Asian trading partners have also been lukewarm in responding to Donald Trump's tariff onslaught.
India is unlikely to retaliate immediately to the 26% reciprocal tariff, instead focusing on negotiating a bilateral trade deal with the US to reduce duties, according to an Indian government official quoted by Reuters.
India views itself as having an edge over regional rivals by being among the first to initiate trade talks with Washington. This positions India better than Asian peers like China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, which have been impacted by higher US tariffs, reported PTI, citing another government official.
On Monday, Hong Kong markets led regional losses, with the Hang Seng Index dropping 10.37%. Mainland China’s CSI 300 fell 6.31%.
Earlier in the day, a fund manager in China had predicted the plunge. “It will be an ugly start on Monday, which will be a buying opportunity for me,” said Xin-Yao Ng, a fund manager at Aberdeen Investments.
“Some estimates suggest tariff wars can bring down China’s GDP growth by 2 percentage points, but the government will negate that pain with stimulus and trade deals with non-US countries in the due course,"" added Xin-Yao Ng,Bloombergreported.
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said it will continue to ask Donald Trump to lower tariffs against Japan, but acknowledged results ""won't come overnight.""
""As such, the government must take all available means"" to cushion the economic blow from U.S. tariffs such as offering funding support for domestic firms and taking measures to protect jobs, Ishiba told parliament,Reutersreported.
South Korea's finance minister said on Monday the government would prepare support measures for sectors with urgent needs, ahead of US President Donald Trump's 25% tariff, which will come into force this week.
""Minister Choi Sang-mok emphasised the need to analyse the impact on the macroeconomy and prepare support measures for sectors with urgent needs,"" the ministry said in a statement, reported Bloomberg.
President Lai Ching-te stated that Taiwan does not plan to retaliate with tariffs and aims to improve reciprocal tariffs through discussions with the US. Talks may begin with a focus on ""zero tariffs,"" while industries like electronics, petrochemicals, and natural gas seek to increase investments in the US, reportedBloomberg, citing a statement from the presidential office.
TheIndian stock marketsharply declined on April 7, following Wall Street's previous downturn. The Nifty 50 opened with a 1,146-point drop, or 5%, at 21,758, marking its largest intraday loss since March 2020. Similarly, the Sensex opened sharply lower, down 5.19% at 71,449.

RBI issues revised priority sector lending norms effective April 1,https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-issues-revised-priority-sector-lending-norms-effective-april-1-11742831534679.html,"Mumbai, Mar 24 (PTI) The Reserve Bank on Monday issued revised guidelines on Priority Sector Lending (PSL) to facilitate better targeting of bank credit to the priority sectors of the economy.
The new guidelines will come into effect from April 01, 2025, the RBI said.
""The enhanced coverage of the revised guidelines is expected to facilitate better targeting of bank credit to the priority sectors of the economy,"" the RBI said in a statement.
The major changes in the new norms include the enhancement of several loan limits, including housing loans for enhanced PSL coverage and the broadening of the purposes based on which loans may be classified under 'renewable energy'.
There is also a revision of the overall PSL target for urban cooperative banks (UCBs) to 60 per cent of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent of Off-Balance Sheet Exposures (CEOBSE), whichever is higher.
The revised norms also expanded the list of eligible borrowers under the category of 'Weaker Sections', along with the removal of the existing cap on loans by UCBs to individual women beneficiaries.
Bank loans to the housing sector for priority sector classification have been prescribed in three categories --₹50 lakh (centres with a population of 50 lakh and above),₹45 lakh (centres with a population of 10 lakh and above but below 50 lakh) and₹35 lakh (centres with a population below 10 lakh).
The maximum cost of dwelling units too has been specified in each case.
On renewable energy, the guidelines said bank loans up to a limit of₹35 crore to borrowers for renewable energy-based power generators and for renewable energy-based public utilities will be eligible for priority sector classification. For individual households, the loan limit will be₹10 lakh per borrower.
The categories under the priority sector include agriculture, MSME, export credit, education, housing, social infrastructure, and renewable energy.

"Nearly 40-50% of white-collar jobs may cease to exist over ‘AI threat’, says Atomberg Founder Arindam Paul",https://www.livemint.com/economy/nearly-40-50-of-white-collar-jobs-may-cease-to-exist-over-ai-threat-says-atomberg-founder-arindam-paul-11742305918551.html,"Mumbai-based household appliances manufacturer Atomberg's Founder and Chief Business Officier, Arindam Paul, in a social media post on LinkedIn, highlighted that nearly 40 to 50 per cent ofwhite collar jobswill cease to exist due to AI threat.
In the social media post on LinkedIn, the founder highlighted that our nation's people and leaders do not understand the scale of the AI threat to theIndian economy, which is likely to affect India's middle class and consumption pattern.
“I don’t think most people including our leaders still understand how big a threat AI could be to our economy,” said Paul, starting his post on LinkedIn.
TheAI threatlooms over the people who have white-collar jobs in India.
“Almost 40-50 per cent white collar jobs that exist today might cease to exist. And that would mean the end of the middle class and the consumption story,” said Paul.
According to the executive's post, India's manufacturing is not close to an extent which can generate jobs paying₹3 to 6 lakh annually.
“Our manufacturing is no where close to where it should be when it comes to generatingjobsthat pay 3-6 lakhs per year,” said Paul in his post.
India's IT services and BPO jobs are expected to witness big layoffs and reduced business operations.
“While i think companies likeInfosysetc will survive and some might even thrive, but even in that case, they won’t be employing nearly as many people as they do,” he said.
Arindam Paul also highlighted that companies in India are now happy thatartificial intelligence(AI) will reduce manpower and increase efficiency on the job. But in that context they are missing out that if more jobs are lost then that's lesser people with money in hand to spend.
“While all corporates are today happy that AI will reduce manpower and increase efficiency and improve bottomline, they forget that without jobs and money in consumer hands, there will be no topline,” said the CIO.
At the end of his post, Paul also highlighted that he hopes that this does not happen in India but also said that it is possible if the nation does not double itsmanufacturingthan current levels.
“I hope none of this happen and we continue to grow our GDP both at an absolute level as well as at a per capita level, but i also think this is the most probable scenario for India unless we really double down on manufacturing,” according to Paul's post on LinkedIn.

Feb job growth shy of estimates, but some investors braced for worse
*
Tariff, federal workforce cuts cloud Wall St outlook
*
Powell says economy ""continues to be in a good place""
By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Laura Matthews
NEW YORK, - A solid U.S. jobs report assuaged some swirling concerns about a rapid growth slowdown, but with policy uncertainty surging and tariff headlines keeping the outlook for risk assets murky, Wall Street sees little to cheer.
U.S. job growth in February was just shy of estimates and the unemployment rate edged up to 4.1%, but investors were bracing for a more dour outcome after a recent spate of worrisome data.
After a punishing selloff in stocks this week, however, markets remained consumed by uncertainty over trade policy and deep federal government spending cuts that could erode the labor market's resilience in the months ahead.
""We've got a relatively expensive market. Mix that with uncertainty and concern and the path of least resistance is downward,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital in Chicago.
""This is just a risk-off mentality and it's going to take a lot of data to convince people otherwise,"" Ablin said.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 151,000 jobs last month after rising by a downwardly revised 125,000 in January, the Labor Department said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls advancing by 160,000 jobs.
The employment report followed data that showed U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter while U.S. retail sales dropped by the most in nearly two years in January.
""It's not quite the softening in economic growth that a lot of investors were expecting based on some of the recent data,"" Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US rates strategy at TD Securities in New York, said.
Investors have been grappling with dramatic policy changes around the world, including President Donald Trump's back-and-forth on implementation of fresh tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.
Risks to the Mexican, Canadian and American economies are piling up amid a chaotic implementation of U.S. tariffs that has created deep uncertainties for businesses and decision-makers, according to Reuters polls of economists taken this week.
""You're not going to hire, you're not going to make capital expenditure plans until you see which way these things fall out,"" said Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management. ""I suspect we'll start to see that come through in future monthly numbers.""
Friday's data did little to turn the tide of bearish sentiment that has gripped Wall Street. Wall Street stocks have sold off sharply this week with the Nasdaq Composite on Thursday confirming it has been in a correction since December, and the S&P 500 on pace for its biggest weekly percentage drop in six months.
Stocks swung wildly on Friday, with the S&P 500 little changed in afternoon trade. Major indexes cut losses following mid-day comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who told an economic forum that the economy ""continues to be in a good place.""
The U.S. central bank will be in no rush to cut interest rates while it waits for more clarity on how Trump administration policies affect the economy, Powell said.
""Powell is giving sense of calm to a market that's been moving very erratically,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief market strategist at Clearnomics.
For some investors, recent signs of weakening growth and the prospect of further market turmoil due to tariffs have been a sign to take some risk off the table and Friday's data did little to shake that conviction.
Carson Group remains overweight equities but now favors more defensive names rather than more volatile, riskier stocks, said Sonu Varghese, the firm's global macro strategist.
With international equities faring better than U.S. markets, investors have also been looking outside the U.S.
""I've been advocating taking profits on U.S. large cap tech positions, which have been big winners, and reallocating into some of the lagging areas of the market like international, and here at home mid-caps and small,"" Talley Leger, chief market strategist at The Wealth Consulting Group, said.
Investors have also been lapping up protection in the options market with demand for defensive options contracts soaring. The Cboe Volatility Index, an options-based measure of demand for protection against a stock market pullback, rose to near 3-week high of 26.56 on Friday.
""Investors are getting very worried about the downside risks to their portfolios,"" Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said in a note.
Wall Street's focus will also turn to how long the Fed remains on hold with interest rate cuts.
The Fed held its benchmark interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range at a policy meeting last month and is expected to do so again at its March 18-19 gathering. Traders of short-term interest rate futures after the report held bets that the Fed would issue about three cuts in 2025, according to LSEG data.
With the jobs data, ""while the worst fears were not met, the report does confirm that the labor market is cooling and that it may require some assistance from the Fed in the coming months,"" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in emailed comments.

"RBI says banks cannot impose excessive charges on loan amounts upto  ₹50,000 under the priority sector lending",https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-says-banks-cannot-impose-excessive-charges-on-loan-amounts-upto-rs-50-000-under-the-priority-sector-lending-11742872804623.html,"New Delhi [India], March 25 (ANI): The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has made it clear that banks cannot impose excessive charges, particularly on smaller loan amounts under the priority sector lending (PSL) category.
The central bank stated that no loan-related and ad hoc service charges or inspection charges shall be levied on priority sector loans up to₹50,000. This step aims to protect small borrowers from unnecessary financial burdens and ensure fair lending practices.
It said ""No loan related and ad hoc service charges/inspection charges shall be levied on priority sector loans up to₹50,000"".
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued new Master Directions on Priority Sector Lending (PSL), which will come into effect on April 1, 2025. The updated guidelines are set to replace the existing framework established under the 2020 PSL directions.
In these guidelines the central bank has also clarified that loans taken against gold jewellery acquired by banks from Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) will not be considered under the priority sector lending category. This means banks cannot classify such loans as part of their PSL targets.
The move is intended to ensure that priority sector funds are directed towards sectors that genuinely need financial support, such as small businesses, agriculture, and weaker sections of society.
It said ""Loans against gold jewellery acquired by banks from NBFCs are not eligible for priority sector status"".
The RBI has also assured that all loans categorized under the earlier PSL guidelines (2020 framework) will remain eligible for priority sector classification until their maturity. This move ensures continuity for borrowers and banks, allowing them to follow a smooth transition to the new guidelines.
To ensure better compliance with PSL targets, the RBI will introduce a more rigorous monitoring system. Banks will now be required to submit detailed data on their priority sector advances on a quarterly and annual basis.
As per the guidelines the data must be reported within fifteen days from the end of each quarter and within one month from the end of the financial year. This step is designed to enhance transparency and accountability in PSL implementation.
Banks that fail to meet their prescribed PSL targets will be required to contribute to the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) and other financial schemes administered by NABARD and similar institutions.
This ensures that even if banks do not meet their direct lending obligations, they still support priority sector development through financial contributions.
The RBI has also reaffirmed that outstanding loans extended under specific COVID-19 relief measures will continue to be classified as priority sector lending. This decision is aimed at supporting sectors that are still recovering from the economic impact of the pandemic.
With these new PSL guidelines, the RBI aims to foster financial inclusion and developmental goals. By ensuring that underserved sectors receive the necessary financial support, the central bank is working towards strengthening the nation's socio-economic growth. The updated PSL framework reflects RBI's commitment to ensuring fair lending practices and directing credit to sectors that need it the most. (ANI)

"India, New Zealand announce resumption of FTA talks after gap of 10 yrs",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-new-zealand-announce-resumption-of-fta-talks-after-gap-of-10-yrs-11742130687859.html,"New Delhi, Mar 16 (PTI) After a gap of about ten years, India and New Zealand on Sunday announced resumption of negotiations for a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) to boost economic ties.
India and New Zealand began negotiating the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in April 2010 to boost trade in goods, services, and investment. However, after ten rounds of discussions, the talks stalled in February 2015.
""The two nations are pleased to announce the launch of negotiations for a comprehensive and mutually beneficial India-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations,"" the commerce ministry said.
The announcement was made after the meeting of Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and Todd McClay, New Zealand's Minister for Trade and Investment.
Prime Minister of New Zealand Christopher Luxon is here on a four-day visit from March 16.
""The India-New Zealand FTA negotiations aim to achieve balanced outcomes that enhance supply chain integration and improve market access,"" it said.
""With bilateral trade continuing to grow steadily, surpassing USD 1 billion during April-January 2025, the FTA negotiations aim to unlock new avenues for businesses and consumers, fostering mutual growth and prosperity of our nations,"" Goyal said in a post on X.
According to think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a major challenge in the renewed talks will be the disparity in tariff structures.
New Zealand's average import tariff is only 2.3 pet cent, with over half of its tariff lines already duty-free, meaning Indian goods already have substantial access to its market.
In contrast, India's average tariff stands at 17.8 per cent, meaning it would have to make significant reductions, making a traditional FTA less attractive for India.
""As talks resume, both countries will need to find common ground on these issues to move forward successfully,"" GTRI Founder Ajay Srivastava said.
He said earlier New Zealand was demanding greater access to India's dairy market, which India resisted to protect its domestic dairy industry that supports millions of farmers.
Currently, India's dairy imports from New Zealand are minimal (around USD 0.57 million), and while India may consider limited imports of value-added dairy products, it remains firm against allowing raw dairy imports, he said.
India was also reluctant to lower tariffs on New Zealand's dairy, meat, and wine exports, while New Zealand pushed for more favourable trade terms.
""Pressure from the US to open India's dairy and agriculture sectors may also influence negotiations,"" Srivastava said, adding that another key issue was India's demand for easier movement of its skilled professionals and better access for its IT and services sector.
India wanted New Zealand to grant work opportunities similar to those given to Australia and China, but New Zealand did not agree, according to GTRI.
It said earlier the FTA talks got complicated as both countries were part of the negotiations around the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which India eventually withdrew from in 2019 due to certain concerns about market access and protecting local industries.
The bilateral trade between the two countries stood at USD 873.4 million (exports USD 538.33 million and imports USD 335 million) in 2023-24 as against USD 1.02 billion in 2022-23.
India's key goods exports to New Zealand include clothing, fabrics, and home textiles; medicines and medical supplies; refined petrol; agricultural equipment and machinery such as tractors and irrigation tools; auto; iron and steel; paper products; electronics; shrimps; diamonds; and basmati rice.
The main imports are agricultural goods, minerals, apples, kiwifruit, meat products such as lamb, mutton, milk albumin, lactose syrup, coking coal, logs and sawn timber, wool, and scrap metals.
In FY24, India's services exports to New Zealand stood at USD 214.1 million, while New Zealand's services exports to India totalled USD 456.5 million.
India's key services exports include IT and software services, provided by companies such as Infosys and HCL, along with telecommunications services to support New Zealand's digital infrastructure.
India also exports healthcare services, including medical tourism, pharmaceutical research, and telemedicine. Financial services are another important area, with Indian banks and fintech companies offering digital payment solutions.
New Zealand's services exports to India are led by education services, with thousands of Indian students pursuing higher education in New Zealand.
Tourism services are also significant, as Indian tourists are drawn to New Zealand's natural landscapes and adventure activities.
New Zealand provides fintech services, offering digital solutions to India's financial sector, and specialised aviation training programmes for pilots and cabin crew.
Additionally, New Zealand firms offer niche IT services such as data analytics and automation solutions.

Indian banks expected to see loan growth of 12-14 per cent in FY26: Report,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indian-banks-expected-to-see-loan-growth-of-12-14-per-cent-in-fy26-report-11743402339154.html,"New Delhi [India], March 31 (ANI): Indian banks are expected to register loan growth of 12-14 per cent in the financial year 2025-26 (FY26), driven by an increase in deposit inflows, according to a report by Ambit Capital Research.
The report highlighted that the banking sector has started seeing some relief in loan-to-deposit ratios (LDRs) after facing challenges related to liquidity and asset quality. This improvement is mainly due to a gradual rise in deposits and a slower pace of loan disbursements.
Experts believe that this trend will be reflected in the period-end LDR as well. Additionally, easing liquidity conditions and a possible reduction in risk weights on unsecured retail loans are expected to support steady loan growth.
It said ""With easing liquidity and probable easing of risk weights on unsecured retail, we expect sector loan growth to stay at 12-14 per cent in FY26E"".
Despite improving liquidity, the report mentioned that the banks are likely to face pressure on their net interest margins (NIMs) in FY26. The reason for this is high deposit costs and falling yields, which could lead to a decline of 5-20 basis points for most lenders.
However, the impact will vary depending on a bank's portfolio mix and liability structure. Banks with a higher share of fixed-rate loans will likely manage their margins better than those with a greater proportion of variable-rate loans.
The report also pointed out a rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) in the retail sector due to an increase in unsecured retail loans such as personal loans and credit cards. While banks had maintained strong asset quality post-COVID, the growing volume of unsecured loans has led to higher retail defaults in recent years.
To address this issue, banks have started consolidating their retail lending portfolios, which will help them identify and manage balance sheet stress by the first half of FY26.
Although credit costs are expected to rise in FY26, banks have built strong provisions ranging from 0.7-1.7 per cent of total loans. The provision coverage ratio (PCR) remains at around 70%, which should provide some cushion against potential defaults.
With liquidity conditions improving and possible regulatory support, such as a reduction in risk weights on unsecured retail loans, the banking sector is expected to grow steadily. However, banks will need to manage deposit costs, margin pressures, and asset quality challenges to maintain financial stability in FY26. (ANI)

Japan firms set to offer large wage hikes for a third straight year,https://www.livemint.com/economy/japan-firms-set-to-offer-large-wage-hikes-for-a-third-straight-year-11741734083607.html,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO, - Many of Japan's biggest companies are expected to offer substantial wage hikes for a third consecutive year when they conclude talks with unions on Wednesday, seeking to help workers cope with inflation and retain staff amid labour shortages.
Last year's ""shunto"" or ""spring labour offensive"" negotiations resulted in the sharpest increase in 33 years, enabling the central bank to exit its decade-long super-loose monetary policy.
Record corporate profits, helped by a weak yen, also support the case for lifting pay and this year economists expect increases to be similar to last year's average hike of 5.1%.
That hike followed a rise of 3.58% in 2023. Before that, annual pay increases for the preceding two decades were between 1-2% and as a result, Japan's wage levels remain well behind the average for the OECD grouping of rich countries.
Rengo, Japan's largest labour union umbrella group with 7 million members, said last week its unions were seeking an average hike of 6.09%, up from 5.85% last year and marking the first time in 32 years that more than 6% has been sought.
Some firms wrapped up their wage negotiations early, responding to union requests in full.
Toyota's top supplier Denso, for instance, agreed on February 17 to record pay hikes, meeting union demands of 23,500 yen per person a month and a bonus equivalent to 6.3 months of wages.
Much of the focus on this year's ""shunto"" talks is whether there will also be strong pay gains at small and medium-sized firms which employ around 70% of Japan's workforce.
Toyota, the bellwether for many Japanese manufacturers, has said it plans to pay more for domestic components to help suppliers fund pay rises.
Broad-based pay increases are seen as a prerequisite for the Bank of Japan to continue to hike its policy rate from a still very low level of 0.5%.
Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government also wants robust wage hikes to boost consumer spending as the rising cost of food and other necessities have contained inflation-adjusted real wages growth to around zero.
The consumer inflation rate used to calculate real wages, which includes fresh food items but not rent costs, rose to 4.7% year-on-year in January - the highest reading in two years.
Even a pay raise of 5-5.5% this year would ""just offset inflation and not drive consumer spending,"" said Kazutaka Maeda, an economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
The annual pay talks are one of the defining features of Japanese business, where relations between labour and management tend to be more collaborative than in some other countries.

"Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs come into effect on April 2: Will India, Thailand feel the most heat?",https://www.livemint.com/economy/donald-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-come-into-effect-from-april-2-india-thailand-to-feel-the-most-heat-11743428629147.html,"President Donald Trump said the reciprocal tariffs he plans to impose on April 2 would include ""all countries"", not just those with the largest trade imbalances with the United States. Donald Trump's ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs are likely to impact several countries, including India, China, the European Union, Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Canada.
However, an S&P analysis suggests that India, South Korea, and Thailand could be the most vulnerable to these tariffs.
Speaking aboard Air Force One, just 48 hours before what he termed “Liberation Day” on April 2, Trump confirmed that these tariffs would be applied universally, breaking away from earlier plans to target only select nations. “We would start with all countries, so let’s see what happens,” Trump told reporters mid-flight.
While Donald Trump refused to put a number to the countries that are likely to be affected by his upcoming tariff salvo, it is expected to affect 15 per cent of US trade partners that have persistent trade imbalances with the United States, a group Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called a ""Dirty 15.""
Further, Japan and South Korea's carmakers were disproportionately affected by measures announced by Trump last week.
President Donald Trump has already slapped tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and additional levies on imports from China. Tariffs on imported autos are also due to take effect on April 3.
Trump's top trade aide, Peter Navarro, said the tax on auto imports could raise $100 billion a year.
""And in addition, the other tariffs are going to raise about $600 billion a year, about $6 trillion over a 10-year period,"" Navarro toldFox News.
Areciprocal tariffis a trade measure in which one country imposes import duties that match or counteract the tariffs applied by another country on its exports, aiming to promote balanced trade and protect domestic industries.
Taking a look at how other countries will be affected:
India is poised to bear consequences as US President Donald Trump announces reciprocal tariffsthat take effect on April 2.
With an average weighted tariff of 9.5 per cent on US exports—among the highest globally—India has become a focal point of Trump’s trade strategy. Key sectors such as pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, automobiles, and food products are expected to face higher duties, potentially costing India up to $7 billion annually.
S&P Global Ratings also said that the low exposure will help India reduce the impact of the tariffs. India’s exports to the US account for just 2.3 per cent of its GDP, the agency added.
India is actively seeking to appease the Trump administration and is open to cutting tariffs on over half of US imports worth $23 billion,Reutersreported last week.
However, the trade imbalance remains a contentious issue, with India exporting $120 billion worth of goods to the US in 2023 against $70 billion in imports.
China, long embroiled in trade disputes with the US, is no stranger to tariffs under Donald Trump’s administration. The US president has long railed against the gaping trade deficit between the world’s two largest economies – and on the campaign trail threatened upwards of 60 per cent duties on all Chinese goods coming into the US.
With a weighted average tariff rate of 7.1 per cent on US exports, China is among the nations most affected by this new measure.
China has already hit back swiftly – though modestly – on the two tranches of additional 10 per cent tariffs Trump has imposed on Chinese imports to the US so far, while sharpening a toolbox of other countermeasures.
Chinese Premier Li Qiang signed an order strengthening China’s “anti-sanctions law,” which allows Beijing to take action against foreign countries that “contain or suppress” China or discriminate against its entities and individuals.
TheEuropean Union (EU) faces similar challenges under Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff regime. As one of the largest trading partners of the US, the EU imposes relatively high tariffs on American goods compared to what it receives. Sectors like automobiles, agriculture, and machinery are expected to be hit hardest by these measures.
The EU is identifying concessions it is willing to make to Donald Trump’s administration to secure the partial removal of the US tariffs that have already started hitting the bloc’s exports, reportedBloomberg.
Trump’s reciprocal tariffs have ignited significant backlash from Canada and Mexico, two of America’s closest trading partners. Effective April 2, these tariffs impose a 25 per cent duty on imports from both nations, targeting a wide range of goods.
While Donald Trump claims the measures are necessary to address trade imbalances and combat the flow of illicit drugs such as fentanyl, leaders in Canada and Mexico have sharply criticised the move as unjust and economically disruptive.
In Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum has denounced the tariffs as baseless, citing data showing a decline in fentanyl seizures at the border. Sheinbaum has promised retaliatory tariffs and rejected Trump’s allegations of inadequate cooperation on border security.
Both nations have warned that these tariffs could undermine existing trade agreements like the USMCA and strain diplomatic relations further.

India to contribute 6% of global trade growth in next five years as China and US lead: DHL report,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-to-contribute-6-of-global-trade-growth-in-next-five-years-as-china-and-us-lead-dhl-report-11742719196631.html,"India is expected to drive global trade growth, contributing 6 per cent in the upcoming five years, according to a joint report from New York University Stern School of Business and DHL named “DHL Trade Atlas 2025.”
According to the research report, India's contribution toglobal tradegrowth is expected to follow China's footsteps at 12 per cent and that of the United States at 10 per cent.
“Indiaalso stands out as the country with the third-largest absolute amount of forecast trade growth (6% of additional global trade), behind only China (12%) and theUnited States(10%),” according to the report.
The South Asian nation (India) is also expected to retain its third spot on the scale dimension and jump to the 17th spot, compared to its current levels of 32nd on the speed dimension metric.
“India, on the other hand, achieved its third-place rank on the scale dimension because itstradegrowth was much faster than other large economies,” according to the research report.
In 2024, India was the 13th largest participant in international trade, with an annual compound growth rate of 5.2 per cent from the year 2019.
According to the official Ministry of Commerce and Industry data, India's totalexportsfor February 2025 (including Merchandise and Services) were $71.95 billion, a 3.16 per cent increase from the $69.74 billion in the same month in 2024.
On the other hand, total trade imports into India dropped 11.33 per cent in February 2025 to $67.52 billion, compared to $76.15 billion in February 2024.
According to the import-export dashboard data, India majorly exports its goods and services to nations like the United States, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and China.
The nation is a major importer ofcommoditiesfrom China, Russia, UAE, and Saudi Arabia.
India imports commodities like petroleum crude, gold, petroleum products, electronic components, coal, and coke, among other key items from foreign nations.
On the exports front, India is an exporter of finished petroleum products, medical drugs, telecom instruments, pearls, electric machinery, etc.
According to the DHL Trade Atlas research report, India's absolute trade volume growth is expected to be 484.0 billion between 2024 and 2029.
“The Trade Atlas underlines India's rapid expansion in global trade, positioning the country as a critical hub connecting the East and West. While we anticipate trade volume growth and an increase in global trade share, we remain cautiously optimistic about the future given the global economy's general volatility,” R S Subramanian, SVP South Asia, DHL Express, told the news agencyANI.

"Indias forex reserves rise to USD 658.8 billion, extending gains for the third week",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-forex-reserves-rise-to-usd-658-8-billion-extending-gains-for-the-third-week-11743237581046.html,"New Delhi [India], March 29 (ANI): India's foreign exchange reserves rose USD 4.529 billion to USD 658.800 billion in the week that ended on March 21, extending gains for the third straight week, official data released by RBI showed.
In the week that ended on March 7, the foreign exchange kitty witnessed the highest weekly gains in over three years.
Before that, forex reserves had slumped for about four months, recently hitting an 11-month low. Then followed the latest rollercoaster movement, with gains some weeks and declines the next.
Forex reserves started falling after touching an all-time high of USD 704.89 billion in September. They are now about 6.5 percent lower from their peak.
The decline in reserves was most likely due to RBI intervention, aimed at preventing a sharp depreciation of the Rupee. The Indian Rupee is now at or near its all-time low against the US dollar.
The latest RBI data showed that India's foreign currency assets (FCA), the largest component of forex reserves, stood at USD 558.856 billion.
Gold reserves currently amount to USD 77.275 billion, according to RBI data.
Estimates suggest that India's foreign exchange reserves are sufficient to cover approximately 10-11 months of projected imports.
In 2023, India added around USD 58 billion to its foreign exchange reserves, contrasting with a cumulative decline of USD 71 billion in 2022. In 2024, the reserves rose by a little over USD 20 billion.
Foreign exchange reserves, or FX reserves, are assets held by a nation's central bank or monetary authority, primarily in reserve currencies such as the US Dollar, with smaller portions in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling.
The RBI often intervenes by managing liquidity, including selling dollars, to prevent steep Rupee depreciation. The RBI strategically buys dollars when the Rupee is strong and sells when it weakens. (ANI)

Indias external debt rises to USD 717.9 bn at Dec-end,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-external-debt-rises-to-usd-717-9-bn-at-decend-11743420634806.html,"New Delhi, Mar 31 (PTI) India's external debt increased by 10.7 per cent to USD 717.9 billion at the end of December 2024 from USD 648.7 billion in December 2023, as per the data released by the finance ministry.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, there is a 0.7 per cent increase in external debt from the level of USD 712.7 billion at the end of September 2024, according to India's Quarterly External Debt Report.
The external debt to GDP ratio stood at 19.1 per cent at the end of December 2024, against 19 per cent in September 2024, it said.
The valuation effect is due to the appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis the rupee and other major currencies, such as the yen, the euro and Special Drawing Rights (SDR), amounting to USD 12.7 billion during the quarter ended December 2024, the report said.
Excluding the valuation effect, the increase in external debt would have been USD 17.9 billion quarter-on-quarter against USD 5.2 billion at the end of December 2024 over September 2024, it added.
""US dollar-denominated debt remained the largest component of India’s external debt, with a share of 54.8 per cent in end-December 2024, followed by Indian Rupee (30.6 per cent), Japanese Yen (6.1 per cent), SDR (4.7 per cent) and Euro (3 per cent),"" it said.
The outstanding external debt of the central government declined while that of the non-government sector increased at December-end 2024 over its level at September-end 2024, it noted.
The share of outstanding debt of non-financial corporations in the total external debt was 36.5 per cent, followed by deposit-taking corporations (except the central bank) (27.8 per cent), central government (22.1 per cent) and other financial corporations (8.7 per cent), according to the report.
Loans were the largest component of external debt, with a share of 33.6 per cent, followed by currency and deposits (23.1 per cent), trade credit and advances (18.8 per cent) and debt securities (16.8 per cent), it added.
Debt service (principal repayments plus interest payments) stood at 6.6 per cent of current receipts at December-end 2024 compared to 6.7 per cent at September-end 2024, it noted.

"India’s private sector growth slows in March, manufacturing stays strong: HSBC flash PMI survey",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-manufacturing-growth-hsbc-india-pmi-india-economic-growth-private-sector-growth-india-forecast-business-outlook-11742807585590.html,"New Delhi: India’s private sector showed signs of softening in March, with overall business activity expanding at a slower pace than in February, according to an HSBC flash survey. While services lost momentum, manufacturing remained a bright spot, sustaining strong growth despite mounting pricing pressures.
The HSBC Flash India Composite Output Index, which tracks manufacturing and services activity, dipped to 58.6 in March from 58.8 in February. A reading above 50 signals growth, while a value below that threshold implies contraction. The index has held above this level for more than three years.
Services lost steam, with the HSBC Flash India Services PMI Business Activity Index slipping to 57.7 from 59.

Manufacturing, however, remained resilient, with the HSBC Flash India Manufacturing PMI rising to 57.6 from 56.3 and the Manufacturing PMI Output Index climbing to 60.6—its highest level since July 2024.
Read this |Madan Sabnavis: Can India’s economy count on manufacturing as an engine of growth?
Pricing pressures presented a mixed picture. Input costs surged at a faster pace, squeezing margins, even as output price inflation fell to its lowest level in over three years, highlighting a divergence between cost and pricing trends.
""India’s manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in March…The output index rose to its highest level since July 2024,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.
Yet, manufacturers faced intensified margin pressures as input costs rose, while factory gate prices increased at their weakest rate in a year, Bhandari noted, adding that the slowdown in new export orders was also notable amid tariff announcements.""
New orders continued their upward streak in March, extending a growth trend that has lasted over three-and-a-half years. The rate of expansion remained strong but eased slightly from February.
""Goods producers indicated a quicker increase than in February and one that was above the growth rate recorded for service providers. Among the latter, the pace of expansion was the second-slowest since November 2023 as firms noted an intensification of competitive pressures,"" the survey noted.
International sales continued to support order books, though new export orders grew at their slowest pace in three months. Manufacturers led the way in overseas business, recording a sharper rise than service firms.
Despite strong business confidence, sentiment slipped to a seven-month low in March. ""Both manufacturers and service providers were slightly less upbeat towards output prospects than in February,"" the survey added.

India’s goal of reaching a $10 trillion economy within the next decade is being driven by manufacturing growth, with a focus on semiconductors, electronics, electric vehicles, renewable energy, and defense. To support this vision, the government has ramped up capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure, job creation, and industrial expansion.

"Centre’s net direct tax collections reach  ₹21.26 trillion, 95% of revised estimates",https://www.livemint.com/economy/net-direct-tax-collections-india-fy25-revised-estimates-tax-revenues-corporate-tax-securities-transaction-tax-gdp-growth-11742223760427.html,"The Centre has collected₹21.26 trillion in net direct taxes so far this fiscal year, reaching 95% of the revised full-year target, the Income Tax Department said Monday after the final advance tax instalment deadline.
Tax revenue, spanning corporate income tax, individual income tax, and securities transaction tax (STT), grew 13.1% year-over-year, outpacing India’s 9.9% nominalGDP growth—a sign of strong tax buoyancy and expanding compliance.
The government has collected₹9.69 trillion in corporate taxes, up 7.1% from the previous year. Meanwhile, non-corporate tax revenue, which includes individuals, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), and firms, rose 17.5% to₹11.01 trillion as of 16 March, compared to₹9.37 trillion in the same period last year.
Securities Transaction Tax collections surged 56% to₹53,095 crore, driven by transactions in equities, derivatives, and equity-oriented mutual funds. STT rates vary from 0.001% to 0.2%, with delivery-based equity transactions taxed at 0.1%.

While gross direct tax collections grew 16.15%, net collections expanded at a slower 13.1%, reflecting a 33% jump in refunds to₹4.6 trillion.
Advance tax collections, which allow businesses and individuals to pay taxes in instalments, grew 14.6% to₹10.44 trillion. Corporate advance tax payments rose 12.54%, while non-corporate advance tax surged 20.47%, signalling broad-based economic activity.
With the final advance tax instalment deadline on 16 March, experts see the strong collections as a sign of India’s economic resilience and expanding tax base.

“This trend not only highlights improved tax compliance but also positions India as a dynamic and thriving market, poised for sustained development. Notably, the Income Tax Department's continuous monitoring through AI-driven systems has played a crucial role in boosting advance tax collections by enhancing compliance and minimizing tax evasion,” said Amit Maheshwari, tax partner at AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm.
However, FY26 personal income tax collections remain uncertain, as the₹1 trillion tax reliefannounced in the Union Budget could weigh on revenues.

"Robust demand, firm business outlook propels India’s services sector growth: Survey",https://www.livemint.com/economy/robust-demand-firm-business-outlook-propels-indias-services-sector-growth-survey-11741153125453.html,"Growth in India's services sector accelerated in February, supported by robust demand and a firm business outlook that led to a substantial increase in hiring, a survey showed.
Asia's third-largest economy expanded6.2% year-over-year last quarter, lifted by government and consumer spending. The government expects India to grow 6.5% for the full financial year on expectations urban consumption will improve after weakening due to feeble job and income growth.
HSBC's final India services Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, rose to 59.0 in February from January's 26-month low of 56.5 but was lower than a preliminary estimate of 61.1.
It has remained above the 50-mark separating expansion from contraction since mid-2021.
""Global demand, which grew at its fastest pace in six months according to the new export business index, played a major role in driving output growth for India's services sector,"" noted Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.
Overall demand for services picked up in February, recovering from January's 14-month low, while growth in foreign orders reached its highest in six months.
Services companies remained optimistic about thebusiness outlook for the upcoming 12-months. The future activity sub-index, gauging sentiment, stayed firm despite falling to a six-month low.
To meet rising demand, companies hired additional staff leading to a strong expansion in employment.
The rate of cost price inflation slipped to a four-month low. Despite that, firms passed on some of the extra burden to customers leading to a higher increase in charge inflation last month.
Inflation in Indiahas mostly remained within the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) target range of 2-6%, prompting the central bank to cut its key repo rate in February. The RBI lowered the interest rate to 6.25% from 6.50% and is expected to ease further to boost the economy.
The substantial rise in services growth offset a 14-month low expansion rate in manufacturing, driving the overall Composite PMI to rise to 58.8 last month from 57.7 in January.

Top pension official calls for national policy to boost retirement coverage,https://www.livemint.com/economy/national-pension-policy-retirement-coverage-pfrda-longterm-capital-infrastructure-financing-11741094605916.html,"New Delhi: A nationalpensionpolicy could boost India’s retirement coverage and, in turn, help channelise longterm resources for infrastructure financing, said Sumeet Kaur Kapur, executive director of India’s Pension Fund Regulator Development Authority (PFRDA).
India currently has more than₹50 trillion of assets under various pension schemes but these account for only about 17% of the country’s gross domestic product, or GDP, Kapur said.
She was addressing a webinar organised by the department of financial services on the ‘regulatory, investment and ease of doing business reforms’ announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget for 2025-26.
“If you look at developed countries, some of the developed countries have more than 100% of their GDP as pension assets. Average in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries is 80%. That is aspirational for us, where we would like to reach if pension sector is to grow and we have to reach a ‘pension-society’ and a Viksit Bharat (developed economy status) by 2047,” Kapur said, making a case for efforts to step up pension coverage.

“We do have growth potential. It is said probably by 2047 we would have advanced to a high-income country and per capita income would have grown 10-13 times as per one of the estimates, giving leverage for pension savings. However, this would not happen on its own. And there would be a focused multi-pronged approach that would be needed to reach there,” said Kapur.
“We have a bit of a fragmented pension space today, and therefore the budget announcement of having a forum is very welcome and the way forward probably would be to collaborate through this forum and develop a national pension policy that would aim for at least one pension account per household and leverage the 53 crores of PM Jan-Dhan Yojana accounts that we already have. This would require innovation in pension,” Kapur said.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana is the government’s flagship financial inclusion scheme. Rolled out in 2014, it carves out affordable access to financial services such as bank accounts, credit, insurance and pensions to all citizens.

India’s pension sector will act as a fulcrum of economic growth by channelising small savings into productive sectors, Kapur said, adding that it is a significant source of longterm capital for infrastructure finance. “It helps in deepening financial markets. It creates a virtuous cycle and it is important we look into this,” said Kapur.
Achieving a $30 trillion economy by 2047 requires reforms in governance and administration, according to Pankaj Sharma, joint secretary in the department of financial services, who moderated the discussion on reforms.
“The critical pillars of that are ‘light-touch regulation’, ‘trust-based governance’, and ‘reduction in compliance burden’. In this connection, some concrete steps have been taken by the government. We are now in the process of drafting Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0, for which consultations are still being held,” Sharma said.
Sitharaman in her budget speech on 1 February had said that the Jan Vishwas Act of 2023 had de-criminalised more than 180 legal provisions and the government would bring up the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 to decriminalize more than 100 other provisions in various laws.

The House also returned the Appropriation Bill (3) with a voice vote.
Earlier in the day, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had moved the two bills in the House.
The Lok Sabha had passed the Finance Bill on March 25 and passed the Appropriation Bill on March 21.
Replying to the debate later in the evening, she said the tendency of the finance ministry would be to exercise caution and not let go of revenues.
""But, here we wanted to use this opportunity to show our respect for Indian taxpayer. We have moved towards setting₹12 lakh as threshold up to which no one will have to pay any tax,"" Sitharaman said.
The Union Budget 2025-26 envisages a total expenditure of₹50.65 lakh crore, an increase of 7.4 per cent over the current fiscal.
The total capital expenditure proposed for the next fiscal is₹11.22 lakh crore and an effective capital expenditure of₹15.48 lakh crore.
It proposes a gross tax revenue collection of₹42.70 lakh crore and a gross borrowing of₹14.01 lakh crore.
According to Budget documents,₹5,41,850.21 crore has been earmarked for Centrally Sponsored Schemes for the financial year starting April 1, 2025. This compares with₹4,15,356.25 crore for the current financial year.
For central sector schemes,₹16.29 lakh crore have been earmarked for FY26 compared to₹15.13 lakh crore for 2024-25.
Budget estimates of expenditure for 2025-26 have increased due to several reasons, including a rise in payment of interest on market loans, treasury bills, external loans, small savings and provident funds; higher requirements of Armed Forces, including capital expenditure; and more provisions for employment generation scheme.
Total resources being transferred to states, including devolution of states' share, grants/loans and releases under Centrally Sponsored Schemes, in Budget 2025-26 are₹25,01,284 crore, a rise of₹4,91,668 crore over the actuals of 2023-24.
The fiscal deficit for FY26 is projected at 4.4 per cent against 4.8 per cent in the current fiscal.
The GDP for FY2025-26 is estimated at₹3,56,97,923 crore, which is 10.1 per cent over the Revised Estimates for FY2024-25 of₹3,24,11,406 crore released by the National Statistical Office(NSO).

"Capex push, fiscal discipline hasn’t come at the cost of social spending cut: Sitharaman",https://www.livemint.com/economy/capex-fiscal-discipline-social-spending-nirmala-sitharaman-rajya-sabha-social-welfare-education-11742297881943.html,"New Delhi: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said the government’s push for capital expenditure (capex), while maintaining fiscal discipline, has not come at the cost of public spending, emphasizing that allocations for social welfare and education have increased significantly.
Speaking at the Rajya Sabha, Sitharaman said the effective capital expenditure for the next fiscal year, 2025-26, is projected to be at₹15.48 trillion, against₹13.18 trillion in the ongoing fiscal, which includes core capital outlays in the Union Budget, and grants and aid allocated to states for creating capital assets.
""But all this is being done without reducing social welfare measures,"" she said adding allocations towards social welfare projects have increased from₹56,501 crore in 2024-25 to₹60,052 crore in 2025-26, and education allocations increased from₹1.26 trillion to₹1.29 trillion during the same period.

India's capital expenditure (Capex) target stands at₹11.21 trillion, according to the budget estimates for 2025-26, compared to the budget estimates of₹11.11 trillion in the previous year.
The central government has also proposed to achieve a fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of India’s gross domestic product for 2025-26, highlighting its commitment to fiscal discipline.
The Centre is on track to achieving a fiscal deficit of 4.8% of GDP in 2024-25, with a further reduction to 4.4% targeted for 2025-26, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in her budget speech in February.
This revised estimate marks an improvement from the earlier target of 4.9% for 2024-25.
Fiscal deficit is the shortfall between a government’s income and expenditure and is expressed as a percentage of GDP.

Meanwhile, countering claims of stagnant employee compensation, Sitharaman cited national accounts statistics to highlight that employee compensation at current prices grew at a compound annual growth rate of 11.1% between 2014-15 and 2022-23, during the first decade of the NDA government.
Sitharaman said that India's household debt remains relatively low compared with both other emerging market economies and several developed nations.
“Household debt, including loans and debt securities, stands at 39% of GDP in India, compared to 35% in Brazil. However, in other comparable countries, the figures are much higher—Malaysia at 69%, Greece at 42%, Hong Kong at 93%, and Australia at 110%. Some are portraying India’s household debt as alarmingly high, but I’m sorry, they are mistaken,” Sitharaman said.
“I want to inform this House that India’s household assets and liability figures are far stronger than those of many comparable emerging market economies,” she said.

She added that consumption inequality in rural and urban areas has declined significantly, as reflected by the significant improvement in the Gini coefficient, a key measure of income inequality.
Sitharaman also defended her government's 'Make in India' initiative stating it has given great momentum for manufacturing in the country.
""India's manufacturing sector has faced significant challenges due to external factors...Making in India has made the defence (sector) become a net exporter,"" she said.
Sitharaman highlighted that the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme has attracted investments of over₹1.5 trillion, generated employment for more than 950,000 people, and boosted exports beyond₹4 trillion.
Meanwhile, answering questions from the opposition, Sitharaman said public sector banks have recovered a total of₹2.27 trillion in written-off loans so far, while private sector banks had clawed by NPAs worth₹55,598 crore.
""Written-off loans do not mean the loans have been waived,"" she said adding public sector banks are taking all recourses to get their money back from defaulters.

"Trumps 27% tariff, not 26%, may boost Indias textile, semiconductor sectors over Asian peers: GTRI",https://www.livemint.com/economy/trumps-27-tariff-not-26-may-boost-indias-textile-semiconductor-sectors-over-asian-peers-gtri-11743655596274.html,"New Delhi [India] April 3 (ANI): The imposition of higher reciprocal tariffs by US President Donald Trump on several Asian and European countries, including China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, and Bangladesh, presents a strategic opportunity for India to strengthen its position in the global trade and manufacturing said GTRI Founder Ajay Srivastava
Srivastava added that goods from India will face a 25 per cent tariff on steel, aluminium, and auto-related goods, and no tariffs on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, copper, or energy products.
For the remaining products, India will be taxed a reciprocal tariff of 27 per cent and not 26 per cent, as reported. The fine print of the notification says India will be subject to a tariff of 27 per cent, says Srivastava.
""Goods from India face a 25 per cent tariff on steel, aluminium, and auto-related goods, and no tariffs on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, copper, or energy products. For the remaining products, India is subject to a reciprocal tariff of 27 per cent,"" he said.
He highlighted that while India faces a 27 per cent tariff, the U.S. has set higher reciprocal tariff rates on goods from other countries, with China facing 54 per cent, Vietnam 46 per cent, Bangladesh 37 per cent, and Thailand 36 per cent. This relatively lower tariff on Indian goods gives India a competitive edge in several sectors.
One key area of opportunity is the textile and garment industry. The high tariffs imposed on Chinese and Bangladeshi textile exports create an opportunity for Indian manufacturers to increase market share, attract new production setups, and expand exports to the U.S.
Srivastava said, ""One of the most prominent areas of opportunity lies in textiles and garments. The high tariffs on Chinese and Bangladeshi exports create room for Indian textile manufacturers to gain market share, attract relocated production, and increase exports to the U.S.""
Given India's strong foundation in textile production and comparatively lower tariff rates, the sector is expected to witness higher global demand and new investments.
Another sector likely to benefit is electronics, including telecom and smartphones. With Vietnam and Thailand facing steep U.S. tariffs, they may lose their cost advantage. India, which has already invested in electronics manufacturing through government initiatives like the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, can position itself as a preferred destination.
The semiconductor industry also offers potential growth opportunities; the 32 per cent tariff on Taiwan could encourage companies to relocate parts of their operations to India, provided the necessary infrastructure and policy support are in place.
Overall, the shift in U.S. trade policies could benefit India by attracting investments in key industries and increasing its role in global supply chains. (ANI)

EU Plans ‘Term Sheet’ of Concessions for Trump Tariff Talks,https://www.livemint.com/economy/eu-plans-term-sheet-of-concessions-for-trump-tariff-talks-11743184039729.html,"The European Union is identifying concessions it’s willing to make to Donald Trump’s administration to secure the partial removal of the US tariffs that have already started hitting the bloc’s exports and that are set to increase after April 2.
EU officials were told at meetings this week in Washington that there was no way to avoid new auto and so-called reciprocal tariffs that Trump is launching next week, according to people familiar with the talks. Discussions also began on what the contours of a potential deal to reduce them should eventually look like.
That has prompted the European Commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, to start working on a “term sheet” for a potential agreement, which would set out areas for negotiations on the punitive trade measures, including lowering its own duties, mutual investments with the US as well as easing certain regulations and standards, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The reciprocal tariffs are meant to strike out against what Trump considers to be unfair levies on US goods as well as non-tariff barriers, such as domestic regulations and how countries collect taxes, including the bloc’s value-added tax, digital taxes and regulations. The EU says its VAT is a fair, non-discriminatory tax that applies equally to domestic and imported goods.
A spokesperson from the commission declined to comment.
Any deal negotiated by his lieutenants would still have to be approved by Trump. This term sheet would form the basis for the commission to hold talks with the US after the reciprocal duties come into effect, said the people. Those tariffs will likely hit all or most of the goods from the EU being exported into the US.
The US hasn’t indicated the tariff level it will apply on the EU but officials in the bloc expect the rate to fall between 10% and 25%, the people said. They added that any future deal would be difficult and wouldn’t restore the status quo, but would leave EU-US trade relations in a worse place than they currently are.
The bloc’s trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s head of cabinet met with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett earlier this week to discuss the situation.
The bloc’s ambassadors were briefed on the discussions this week. The talks with the US made scant headway and there’s little the EU can do to keep next week’s levies from being imposed, Bloomberg previously reported.
Non-tariff issues such as the VAT, digital taxes and several EU regulations and food standards featured prominently during the talks in Washington, as the Trump administration has focused its attacks on what it considers to be unfair barriers to American products that the US believes contribute to a transatlantic imbalance favoring Europe. The EU also raised the possibility of additional liquefied natural gas and defense-related purchases.
European officials have tried stressing that even though the EU has a goods trade surplus with the US, the 27-nation bloc imports a lot of American services ranging from ecommerce and social media sites to Internet search engines — all part of the US’s Big Tech industry that has recently cozied up to Trump and his circle of advisers. EU and US firms have more than €5 trillion worth of investment in each other’s markets, according to the commission.
In addition to the reciprocal levies, the US is planning further tariffs on a number of sectors including metals, cars, pharmaceuticals, lumber and semiconductors. Trump announced a 25% levy on cars and some auto parts this week.
Tariffs on the remaining sectors are expected in the future, the people said. Negotiations on those sectoral duties may be even more complicated as the US goal is to boost American industry and to return production in the US.
Earlier this month, the US imposed a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, which led the EU to propose its own retaliatory duties on up to €26 billion of politically sensitive American goods. The EU has been consulting with governments and industry on the target list and its response is expected to be rolled out by mid-April, following a member state vote around April 9, one of the people said.
Trump has threatened to impose a 200% tariff on European wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages if the EU moves forward with a levy on American whiskey exports currently due on April 14.
The EU’s toolbox of possible responses also allows for restrictions that go beyond tariffs, including quotas on imports, the suspension of concessions as well as actions on public procurement contracts, services and intellectual property aspects of trade, Bloomberg reported earlier.
The bloc is unlikely to respond immediately to the reciprocal tariffs as it will need time to assess exactly what Trump introduces, the people said. The EU’s trade ministers are due to meet on April 7 to discuss the US measures and the EU’s potential response.

Jobless Claims by US Federal Workers Remain High for Second Week,https://www.livemint.com/economy/jobless-claims-by-us-federal-workers-remain-high-for-second-week-11741302269228.html,"Applications for unemployment benefits filed by federal employees remained at an elevated level for a second week as the Trump administration moves to dramatically shrink the size of the federal government.
There were 1,580 initial claims filed nationwide in the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program for the week ended March 1, slightly down from 1,634 the previous week but much higher than earlier in the year, according data posted on the Department of Labor’s website on Thursday. For comparison, the weekly average last year was about 400.
The number of continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, filed by federal workers for the week ended Feb. 22 was 8,215, up from 7,412 the week prior. The data is subject to revision before it’s reported in the March 13 weekly jobless claims report.
Already, Bloomberg Economics estimates tens of thousands of federal jobs have been cut since President Donald Trump took office in January and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, started firing government workers across US agencies and canceling federal contracts.
Georgia had the most initial claims filed by federal workers last week at 277, followed by 229 from California, 139 from Texas, 129 from Maryland and 115 from Washington, DC, data posted Thursday show.
Applications filed by out-of-work federal employees are reported separately from those of other workers. In data published earlier Thursday by the Labor Department, overall applications for US unemployment benefits last week decreased to 221,000, returning to muted levels seen earlier in the year.

US reciprocal tariffs unlikely to impact India much; may create opportunities: Niti Aayog Official,https://www.livemint.com/economy/us-reciprocal-tariffs-unlikely-to-impact-india-much-may-create-opportunities-niti-aayog-official-11743158023580.html,"New Delhi, Mar 28 (PTI) The US plan to impose reciprocal tariffs will not have much impact on India and create several opportunities for the country, Niti Aayog Programme Director Pravakar Sahoo said on Friday.
Compared to Mexico, China and Canada, which account for 50 per cent of America's total imports, India is favourably placed, he added.
""We are looking at the data at a very dis-segregated level...these are preliminary results, but I can just give you the overview that we are not going to lose. This reciprocal tariff is not going to affect except very specific sectors and in fact, there are opportunities to really capture,"" he added.
Sahoo was speaking after the release of the second edition of Niti Aayog's quarterly trade watch.
He said that a detailed analysis of the reciprocal tariff plan's impact on India will be presented in the next edition of the report.
The three main competitors in the US market are - Canada, Mexico and China. They account for 50 per cent of the USA's total imports of USD 3.1 trillion. These countries are going to face tariffs in the range of 20-25 per cent.
""So, if we compare our position...and post-imposition of these tariffs on our competitors in the US market, we are much much better off,"" he said.
The US has imposed 25 per cent import duties on steel and aluminium products from March 12 and it has also announced a sweeping 25 per cent tariff on completely built vehicles (CBUs) and auto parts, a move set to take effect on April 3.
US President Donald Trump has announced imposing reciprocal tariffs in April on America's key trading partners, including India. He has on multiple forums stated that India imposes high tariffs on US goods. The US has already imposed duties on China.
A team of US officials, headed by Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia Brendan Lynch, is here for negotiations on the proposed bilateral trade agreement with India. The negotiations are likely to conclude on Saturday.
India and the US are aiming to conclude the first phase or tranche of the agreement by the fall of 2025 (September-October). They have also set a target to more than double the bilateral trade to USD 500 billion by 2030 from the current over USD 190 billion.
After the imposition of duties by the US in 2018, the share of China in US imports has declined.
Speaking at the event, Niti Aayog member Arvind Virmani said that five countries gained from that - Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico and India.
He suggested looking for trade agreements with those countries with large shares of manufacturing, which are sources of FDI and which are the headquarters of MNCs as they can act as lead anchor investors.
""The top countries in this context are the US, EU, Japan, UK and S Korea,"" he said.

Trump Vows US Will Respond to Europe’s Metal Tariff Retaliation,https://www.livemint.com/economy/trump-vows-us-will-respond-to-europe-s-metal-tariff-retaliation-11741896395060.html,"Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. .
President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports came into force Wednesday, triggering an immediate reprisal from the European Union as the global trade war enters a new and perilous phase.
The latest US tariffs — which were applied without exemptions — kicked in after a tumultuous day at the White House, when Trump threatened to double the metals tariffs on Canada to 50%. He backed off when Ontario agreed to drop plans to impose a surcharge on electricity sent to the US — all while downplaying the risk of a tariff-led recession that has sent US markets plunging.
Follow The Big Take DC podcast wherever you listen.
The metals tariffs apply worldwide, with effects extending to economic rivals as well as close US allies. Major Asian producers including South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia held off on retaliating. The UK said it would focus on “rapidly negotiating a wider economic agreement.”
China, which wasn’t explicitly targeted in the latest trade salvo, didn’t immediately respond — but it did summon US retailer Walmart Inc., following reports the US retailer was urging Chinese suppliers to help absorb higher costs.
The European Commission had the strongest reaction so far. It launched “swift and proportionate countermeasures” on US imports, reimposing balancing measures from 2018 and 2020 and adding a new list of industrial and agricultural goods. The EU’s countermeasures will apply to US goods exports worth up to €26 billion — matching the economic scope of the US tariffs, it said.
“We deeply regret this measure,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. “Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers.”
Trump’s move to widen his trade offensive comes at a hazardous juncture seven weeks into his second term. His rapid effort to rewire the US economy as a global manufacturing power has rattled financial markets, spooked consumers still haunted by pandemic-era inflation and fueled recession fears amid mounting uncertainty for corporate America.
Investors largely took the news in stride. Aluminum was up 0.3% on the London Metal Exchange after the tariffs kicked in, while hot-rolled coil — a key steel product — rose 0.4% on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Stocks were little moved.
Trump pressed on with the metals tariffs despite a flurry of last-minute lobbying from US stakeholders, including the country’s largest aluminum producer, Alcoa Corp. The company warned the tariffs would imperil tens of thousands of jobs while raising prices for Americans already feeling their household budgets squeezed.
The president acted with the backing of some domestic industry executives, who say the protectionist measures could raise profits for US producers and bring steel and aluminum jobs back from overseas.
Steel and aluminum levies are part of Trump’s plan to build significant barriers around the US economy, moves he has cast as necessary to rebalance a global trading system that is “ripping off” the nation. Yet his indecision on some duties has raised questions about his resolve.
Trump last week allowed 25% tariffs to take effect on Canada and Mexico tied to illegal drugs and migration, but within days announced a month-long exemption for goods covered by the North American trade agreement. At the same time, he doubled a similar tariff on China to 20%.
Trump’s steel and aluminum orders revive and expand his 2018 levies on the metals and prohibit exemptions for products made from either of them. That means some $150 billion worth of imported consumer goods get hit with the new tariffs, according to research from Global Trade Alert, in addition to raw steel and aluminum.
Trump’s first administration granted exclusions for major suppliers, including Canada, Mexico, Brazil and the European Union, so that some months, fewer than half of imports were covered by the tariffs. Administration officials have warned not to expect future carveouts.
He has also opened the door to tariffs on copper, a critical mineral for the global economy, by directing the Commerce Department to investigate trade restrictions.
Tariff Anxiety
Anxiety that tariffs and Trump’s government downsizing push will stifle US growth has fueled a three-week stretch of volatility in global markets.
“Traders and investors do feel the heat from these tariffs rising,” said Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities in Singapore. “We are increasingly pricing in an escalating trade conflict.”
Trump’s advisers are crafting so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on trading partners worldwide that could take effect as soon as April 2. He’s also promised duties on automobiles, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, lumber and agricultural products.
Many US manufacturers have championed Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum, arguing subsidized foreign rivals — especially China, producing more than it can consume at home — have unfairly set out to dominate the industry, rob market share and jobs from US suppliers. They argue the metal industry is critical to the US industrial base and national security.
“Strengthening the steel and aluminum tariffs” will help incentivize “companies to boost output, make new investments and hire workers,” said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. “Including derivative steel products makes a lot of sense to ensure that importers can’t game the system and American companies that make these products have a level playing field.”
The nation’s largest steelmakers, including Nucor Corp., United States Steel Corp., Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. and Steel Dynamics Inc, last week urged Trump to “resist” calls for carveouts, warning that previous exemptions prompted a surge of imports, causing prices to drop and their profits to shrink.
Before the exemptions, Trump’s 2018 tariffs helped boost prices — and reduce imports — of both steel and aluminum.
The US steel industry is coming off its worst year since Trump’s first term, as lackluster construction demand, inflation on input materials and high borrowing costs crushed their earnings. While imports rose in 2024, they remained lower than 2022 and 2021. Steel inventories are near a multi-year high, sitting in warehouses awaiting an increase in demand.
The tariffs present a more complex challenge for the aluminum industry. Unlike American steelmakers, aluminum producers have a greater global footprint. More than half of the metal consumed in the US is made in Canada, where the biggest producers are Rio Tinto Group and Pittsburgh-based Alcoa.
Alcoa Chief Executive Officer William Oplinger, Rio Tinto representatives, the president of the US Aluminum Association and others have recently been directly involved in lobbying the Trump administration to avoid the added tariffs on Canadian imports, according to people familiar with the discussions who asked not to be named because they were private.
Oplinger predicts devastating consequences from a 25% tariff, including the loss of about 20,000 direct US aluminum industry jobs and another 80,000 indirect jobs.
Economists predict the tariffs are likely to drive up costs for some domestic industries that are heavily reliant on foreign supplies of specialty steel. That includes the oil industry, which uses steel pipes and other materials at wells. Higher costs for steel and aluminum also could trickle down to consumers in the form of more expensive automobiles, appliances and even canned drinks.
Supporters of the president’s plan argue the tariffs ultimately will help drive more manufacturing to the US. And while even the president has acknowledged there may be some short-term economic pain from his broader tariff onslaught for US consumers, administration officials say extended tax cuts and more domestic energy production should help offset those costs.
While many countries affected by the fresh tariffs didn’t retaliate, they also weren’t happy about the moves. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters that the Trump administration’s actions were “entirely unjustified” and an act of “economic self-harm.”
“This is against the spirit of our two nations’ enduring friendship,” Albanese said. “And fundamentally at odds with the benefits that our economic partnership has delivered over more than 70 years.”

He showed no signs of backing away from histariff plansand asserted that trade partners are ""coming to the table"" and “want to talk.”
“I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,"" Trump said. ""They’re dying to make a deal. And I said, we’re not going to have deficits with your country. We’re not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We’re going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.”
On the topic of China, Trump said he would not make a deal unless the trade deficit is solved. However, he has spoken to European and Asian leaders on the tariffs rolled out by his administration, Trump added.
“We have to solve our trade deficit,” particularly with China, Trump said. He said he wouldn’t make a deal unless it drives down the US trade deficit in goods with China. “I want that solved,” he said.
Trump's Cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force Sunday, defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy.
“There doesn’t have to be arecession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week?"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. “What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.”
Asian markets saw a turbulent start on Monday as Wall Street futures tumbled and investors bet that growing recession risks in the US could prompt rate cuts as early as May.
India's Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex trimmed some losses from the pre-open trade, declining 3.84% to 22,030.25 and 3.72% to 72,600.53, respectively as the market opened.  All 13 major sectors logged losses.

On Sunday, Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures fell nearly 4% while Nasdaq futures were down nearly 5%. Even the price of bitcoin, which held relatively stable last week, fell nearly 6% Sunday. US futures took a hit as the tariffs continued to roil the markets.
The US customs agents began collecting Trump's unilateral 10% tariff on all imports from many countries on Saturday. Higher ""reciprocal"" tariff rates of 11% to 50% on individual countries are due to take effect on Wednesday

States capital outlays expected to moderate in 2025-26: Report,https://www.livemint.com/economy/states-capital-outlays-expected-to-moderate-in-2025-26-report-11743308269549.html,"New Delhi [India], March 30 (ANI): The Budgets tabled by the states so far in 2025 indicate that growth in their collective capital outlays is projected to moderate, mimicking the trend seen in the Union budget this year, as per a report by Elara Capital.
Elara Capital said it has analysed the Budget documents presented by 18 states.
The financial services firm projected states' capital outlay to fall 15.9 per cent year-on-year in 2025-26 versus the prior two years' average growth of 23.4 per cent.
However, as a rate of GSDP (gross state domestic product), the capital outlay has been steady at 2.8 per cent, a tad above 2.7 per cent in 2024-25(RE).
""Yet, with only 54.3 per cent of the revised estimates being spent till January this financial year, it seems unlikely that the target for 2024-25(RE) will be achieved,"" said the Elara Capital report on states' capex.
Among key sectors, water supply, sanitation and irrigation are focus areas for 2025-26, whereas roads are witnessing a sharp moderation in allocation.
""The pivot away from traditional sectors such as roads, both by the Centre and states, to emerging sectors such as water supply, sanitation, digital infrastructure, urban, and Irrigation will aid order inflows for diversified infrastructure companies...over sectoral specialized companies (standalone road EPC plays),"" said Elara Capital.
The Union capital expenditure for 2025-26 is expected to grow by 10.08 per cent year-on-year in 2025-26(BE), following a growth of 30 per cent through 2020-21-2023-24.
As per the Elara Capital report, Maharashtra is set to de-grow capital outlay; while Andhra Pradesh targets to raise capital outlay sharply in 2025-26.
Maharashtra, after projecting a massive overspending in 2024-25(RE), has budgeted a de-growth in capital outlay by 11.1 per cent year-on-year in 2025-26(BE), against a 31 per cent year-on-year growth in 2024-25(RE).
Other states that have seen a decline in allocation to capital outlay in 2025-26 are Bihar (-7.2 per cent), Assam (-13.4 per cent), and Himachal Pradesh (-55 per cent). On the other hand, states such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh continue to push ahead with robust capital investment plans.
Andhra Pradesh leads with an impressive 68.8 per cent increase in projections, followed by Gujarat (36.1 per cent) and Uttar Pradesh (11.9 per cent).
Capital expenditure, or capex, is used to set up long-term physical or fixed assets. (ANI)

India’s wholesale inflation rises to 2.38% in February,https://www.livemint.com/economy/wpi-inflation-rises-to-2-38-in-february-wholesale-prices-food-prices-fuel-power-manufactured-products-11742208373456.html,"New Delhi: India’sinflationbased on wholesale prices rose to 2.38% in February, up from 2.31% in the previous month, show the Union commerce ministry’s provisional data released on Monday.
The rise in wholesale price index-based inflation in February was led by a slower pace of contraction in fuel and power inflation and a pick-up in the prices of manufactured products.
The latest wholesale inflation, a proxy for producer prices, was marginally higher than the 2.36% projected by economists in a Reuters poll.
Food prices, a major contributor to the index, increased by 5.94% annually in February, but eased from December’s 8.85% rise and January’s 7.47%.
In February, cereal prices rose 6.77% annually, but was down from the 7.33% growth reported in January. Vegetable prices fell 5.80% during February after an 8.35% surge the previous month, but prices of onions and fruits rose during the month.
Food prices have remained elevated for over a year, primarily during November 2023-June 2024, due to uneven and below-normal monsoon rains.
""Food inflation softened, largely helped by broad-based slowdown. The vegetable inflation index eased the most, followed by food-grain inflation, and inflation of protein-based items (milk, eggs meat and fish). Among vegetables, tomato and potato prices registered a decline, while that of onions are showing some build-up,” said Sonal Badhan, economist at the Bank of Baroda.
“Going forward, as trade war deepens further and uncertainty around Fed (US Federal Reserve) rate cut looms, volatility in market is expected to remain. Commodity prices are seeing some build-up in pressure as demand rose ahead of tariff implementation dates,” she added.

Manufactured product prices, which make up around 64% of the wholesale price index, rose by 2.86% annually in February, up from 2.51% in January and 2.14% in December.
Fuel and power prices fell 0.71% year-on-year against a 2.57% and 2.78% decline in December and January, respectively.
“The uptick was predominantly on account of non-food items, whereas the WPI-food inflation eased to a six-month low of 5.9% from 7.5% in the previous month, led by a broad-based cooling across most primary food articles, including a sharp correction in vegetables,” said Rahul Agrawal, senior economist, ICRA Ltd.
“The downward pressure on the headline print on account of the dip in food inflation was offset by the narrowing deflation in the fuel and power segment, and an uptick in the core (non-food manufacturing) WPI inflation to a 24-month high of 1.3%,” he added.
Prices of non-food articles rose 4.84% annually in February, up from 2.95% year-on-year growth reported in January.
Prices of primary articles—which include food articles, non-food articles, minerals, and crude petroleum and natural gas—rose 2.81% in February, against January’s 4.69% rise.
Retail inflation, based on the consumer price index (CPI), was at 3.61% in February, down from 4.26% in January, according to official data released last week.
To be sure, last month, the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reset its repo rate to 6.25%, the first such easing since the 2020 covid outbreak.
Regulating interest rates is key for the central bank to control inflation.
A higher interest rate regime makes borrowing costs more expensive, reducing demand among banks, financial institutions, and the general public, which, in turn, can bring down consumer spending and inflation.
RBI’s medium-term target for CPI inflation is 4% within a band of plus or minus 2%.

"Customs duty cuts a continuous process, not linked to today’s global situation: FM",https://www.livemint.com/economy/customs-duty-cuts-global-situation-finance-minister-tariffs-india-trump-11743089691887.html,"Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday said that reduction in basic customs duty announced by the government in the recent past has been a continuous process aimed at improving self-reliance and for the country’s development, and not in response to the reciprocal tariffs that the US government said will impose.
Speaking in Rajya Sabha in response to the discussion on Finance Bill 2025, Sitharaman said that India’s tariff changes were meant for realising India’s aspirations in the manufacturing sector.
The minister said that the customs rate structure announced in the July 2024 budget was followed up in this year’s budget. The minister said that as a result of two tranches of rationalisation, the number of customs tariff rates has come down from 21 to eight.
The minister also explained that the government has stated that only one—either the cess or a surcharge – will be applied on the same item. Social welfare surcharge is exempted on 82 tariff lines which are already subject to a cess.
Budget 2025 also proposed to add 35 additional capital goods used in production of electric vehicle batteries, and 28 additional capital goods important for production of mobile phone battery to the exempted goods list, the minister said.
The idea is to encourage production of EV batteries, mobile phones and mobile phone batteries in this country, the minister said.
Sitharaman also pointed out that the full basic customs duty exemption announced in this year’s budget to cobalt powder, the scrap of lithium ion battery, lead, zinc and 12 other critical minerals are in addition to the 25 critical minerals which were fully exempted from basic customs duty in the July 2024 budget.
“Consistently, budget after budget, we are coming up with reduction in duties,” the minister said, adding that the intention of supporting advanced chemistry is to help meet India’s aspiration to build capacities for battery manufacturing and for being a manufacturing hub.
“This is a consistent thing,” Sitharaman said. The minister also said she heard “quite a few members” saying that India’s tariff reductions are in response to the tariff announcements made by President Trump.
“No, we have been doing it from 2023,” Sitharaman said. The minister added that steadily, every year, newer items were given tariff reductions keeping in mind the goal of making the country self-reliant as well as to meet the requirements of becoming a developed nation while also simplifying the customs duty and the compliance details.
“This is an ongoing process. It has nothing to do with today’s global situation. But a process which will continue even in the future,” the minister said.
The finance minister also told the House that the government has laid a fiscal consolidation path--both for the immediate term and the medium term. The minister said the government will achieve the fiscal deficit target. For FY26, the government has set a fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP.

"Govt analysing impact of 26 pc Trump tariff on India; its mixed bag, not setback: Official",https://www.livemint.com/economy/govt-analysing-impact-of-26-pc-trump-tariff-on-india-its-mixed-bag-not-setback-official-11743646309197.html,"New Delhi, Apr 3 (PTI) The commerce ministry is analysing the impact of 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs or import duties imposed by the US on India, a senior government official said on Thursday.
According to the official, the universal 10 per cent tariffs will come into effect on all imports into the US from April 5 and the remaining 16 per cent from April 10.
""The ministry is analysing the impact of the announced tariffs,"" the official said, adding there is a provision that if a country would address the concerns of the US, the Trump administration can consider reducing the duties against that nation.
India is already negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with the US. The two countries are aiming to finalise the first phase of the pact by fall (September-October) of this year.
""It is a mixed bag and not a setback for India,"" the official said.
The US President listed the high tariffs charged by India on American products as he announced reciprocal tariffs on countries across the board, declaring a 26 per cent ""discounted"" reciprocal tariff on India.
""This is Liberation Day, a long-awaited moment. 2nd April 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again. We are going to make it wealthy, good, and wealthy,"" Trump said on Wednesday in remarks from the Rose Garden at the White House as he announced the closely watched reciprocal tariffs on countries that impose levies on American goods.
As he announced the tariffs, he held up a chart that showed the tariffs that countries such as India, China, the UK, and the European Union charge, along with the reciprocal tariffs that these countries will now have to pay.
The chart indicated that India charged 52 per cent tariffs, including currency manipulation and trade barriers, and America would now charge India a discounted reciprocal tariff of 26 per cent.
""India, very, very tough. Very, very tough. The prime minister just left. He's a great friend of mine, but I said, you're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right. They charge us 52 per cent...,"" he said.

"RBI likely to continue rate cuts in April, says BofA; sees repo rate at 5.5% by year-end",https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-likely-to-continue-rate-cuts-in-april-says-bofa-sees-repo-rate-at-5-5-by-yearend-11743396580550.html,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) appears on track for another round of monetary easing in its April Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, according to Bank of America (BofA) Global Research. The firm expects the central bank to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points (bp), bringing it down to 6 percent. BofA said the path for further easing seems clear, with headline inflation likely to remain below 4 percent over the next few months and exchange rate pressures easing substantially.
BofA highlighted that the alignment of economic data—including stable but non-inflationary growth and subdued price pressures—should provide the RBI with enough room to continue its rate-cutting cycle. The firm, however, cautioned that the potential implementation of reciprocal tariffs on April 2 could present some uncertainty. While this may marginally impact growth and inflation, BofA believes it is unlikely to significantly influence the April MPC decision.
BofA noted that macroeconomic projections further validate the case for rate reductions. The RBI currently forecasts FY26GDP growthat 6.7 percent, which it considers slightly optimistic compared to its own estimate of 6.5 percent and the Ministry of Finance’s range of 6.3–6.8 percent. The firm does not anticipate major revisions to the growth forecast but believes the RBI might make slight downward adjustments, given recent upward revisions in the GDP base.
On the inflation front, BofA projected that the RBI is likely to undershoot its Q4 FY25 inflation target of 4.4 percent by 40–60 bp, based on its own tracking estimates. For FY26, the RBI’sinflationprojection of 4.2 percent may also prove conservative, given the ongoing decline in oil prices, a stabilizing rupee, and weak aggregate demand. While heatwaves during the summer pose some inflationary risk, the brokerage expects robust food production to limit any upside. Consequently, the firm anticipates the RBI could lower its near-term inflation projections, keeping the FY26 Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast around 4 percent.
The broekrage expects the RBI to remain committed to its rate-cutting trajectory. The February MPC meeting marked the beginning of the easing cycle, and the firm believes this will continue in April. BofA anticipates that the central bank will offer forward guidance, indicating that its monetary policy will prioritize reviving growth momentum while keeping inflation within the 2–6 percent tolerance range.
BofA continues to expect a cumulative 100 bp of rate cuts in this cycle, including the 25 bp delivered in February. This would bring the repo rate to 5.5 percent by the end of 2025, a level the firm considers close to the neutral rate. Additionally, the central bank is expected to keep liquidity taps open. BofA noted that the RBI has already injected approximately₹5 trillion of durable liquidity into the banking system since December through variable rate repo operations, bond purchases, and forward swaps. The firm expects further liquidity measures in the coming months to enhance credit availability.
The RBI could revise its growth and inflation projections downward in the upcoming April Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, according to the brokerage. Despite the upgraded historical growth trajectory, BofA noted that recent GDP data does not indicate a sharp recovery. The firm expects the RBI to moderately reduce its growth estimates for FY26 while also trimming near-term inflation forecasts, given the sharper-than-expected decline in food prices.
BofA highlighted that during the February policy meeting, the RBI projected FY26 GDP growth at 6.7 percent, 30 basis points (bp) above its FY25 estimate of 6.4 percent. However, the firm believes that incoming data does not support an aggressive recovery. Despite the upward revision in historical GDP figures, BofA noted that the latest data for January and February suggests a moderate but consistent recovery.
The firm’s own projections indicate that growth is likely to recover from approximately 6.3 percent in FY25 to 6.5 percent in FY26. BofA cited various growth trackers and high-frequency indicators, which show that the recovery, which began gradually in November, has continued steadily. The firm believes risks to its GDP projections remain evenly balanced, suggesting limited downside.
BofA expects the RBI to release its long-term inflation forecasts in April, coinciding with the publication of the monetary policy report. The firm anticipates that the central bank may lower its near-term inflation projections, given the steeper-than-expected decline in food prices. However, BofA cautioned that the RBI may incorporate some cushion into its estimates due to rising summer temperatures, which could create inflationary pressures.
Despite the current moderation in food inflation, BofA does not expect the RBI to project headline inflation significantly below 4 percent over the forecast horizon. The firm continues to forecast Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation at 4.1 percent for FY26, slightly below the RBI’s projection of 4.2 percent.

Haryana government launches tax dispute settlement scheme for small traders,https://www.livemint.com/economy/haryana-government-launches-tax-dispute-settlement-scheme-for-small-traders-11742732118450.html,"Kurukshetra (Haryana) [India], March 23 (ANI): The Haryana government brought in a one-time tax settlement scheme, aimed at providing some tax relaxation and waiving off of penalties for small traders.
Over and above the tax exemption and penalty waive off, the state government under Nayab Singh Saini decided that it would exempt 60 per cent of outstanding amount (less than₹10 lakh) that is due for payments.
""For disputed taxes under₹10 lakh, taxpayers will pay 40 per cent of the outstanding amount,"" the chief minister said.
For disputes₹10 lakh to₹10 crore, taxpayers will pay 50 per cent of the outstanding amount.
For disputes above₹10 crore, taxpayers will have to pay full outstanding amount. They will be able to take the benefits of the tax and penalty exemption.
This one-time settlement scheme will come into effect starting April 7, the chief minister announced, speaking to reporters after the launch event.
""We have brought a scheme for the small businessmen...One Time Settlement Scheme will be beneficial for small traders... this scheme will not only benefit big industrial units and taxpayers but will also benefit small-scale taxpayers. The state is developing due to the hard work and contribution of taxpayers. Such schemes help the country and the state to progress...,"" the chief minister briefed reporters.
""I thank all the taxpayers of Haryana, due to whom Haryana has become the leading state of the country in tax collection,"" he later wrote on X, in Hindi.
Addressing a long-standing request from Haryana's traders and business community to settle pending tax payments from before the implementation of GST, a One Time Settlement-2023 (OTS) Scheme was launched -- operational from January 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024. (ANI)

"India must brace for 9-10% power demand surge in 2025 amid rising temperatures, warn experts",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-must-brace-for-9-10-power-demand-surge-in-2025-amid-rising-temperatures-warn-experts-11742873975548.html,"New Delhi, India should prepare for a nine to 10 per cent growth in peak electricity demand this summer with the country expected to experience more heatwaves, experts have warned.
Last year, the all-India peak electricity demand crossed 250 gigawatts on May 30, which was 6.3 per cent higher than projections. Climate change-induced heat stress is one of the key factors driving electricity demand.
Currently, industries, households and agriculture account for 33 per cent, 28 per cent and 19 per cent of India's total electricity consumption, respectively. Household electricity demand has grown the fastest over the past decade, according to Disha Agarwal, Senior Programme Lead – Renewables at the Delhi-based think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water.
The share of household electricity consumption increased from 22 per cent in 2012-13 to 25 per cent in 2022-23. Much of this rise can be attributed to economic growth and the increasing need for cooling due to rising temperatures, experts say.
In the summer of 2024, room air conditioner sales surged by 40 to 50 per cent year-on-year amid record-breaking temperatures, Agarwal said.
""India must now brace for extended heatwaves and a peak electricity demand growth of 9-10 per cent. However, our analysis shows that this peak demand will only last for a short period,"" she added.
Agarwal said India's electricity consumption has been growing at about 9 per cent annually since 2020-21, compared to 5 per cent per year in the previous decade. The Central Electricity Authority had estimated that electricity demand would grow at a rate of 6 per cent per year from 2022 to 2030.
At the ""Global Heat and Cooling Forum"", organised by the Natural Resources Defense Council last week, experts raised concerns about the increasing demand for air conditioning as summer temperatures continue to rise.
Abhas Jha, Practice Manager, Infrastructure Resilience Policy and Finance for South Asia at the World Bank, said that under a moderate emissions scenario, the number of heatwaves in India is expected to triple.
""India is set to become the largest market for air conditioners globally. Every 15 seconds, an air conditioner is sold in India. AC penetration in the country is currently around 8 per cent compared to 90 per cent in developed nations,"" he said.
""AC penetration in India is going to increase. The problem is that most of these air conditioners are highly energy-inefficient three-star or unstarred, or unbranded ACs that consume a lot of energy. And if we continue on this trajectory, forget 1.5 degrees Celsius, even 2 degrees Celsius is off the table,"" Jha said.
A few years ago, the International Energy Agency projected that energy demand from air conditioners would triple by 2050, equivalent to adding 10 new air conditioners every second for the next 30 years.
""In spite of that rise, two to five billion people will still lack access to air conditioners in 2050,"" said Rishika Khosla, Research Director of the Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development at the University of Oxford.
She said ongoing research has shown that in a world two degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the largest cooling demand, in terms of total population, will come from India, followed by China, Nigeria, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, the Philippines, and the US.
Khosla said achieving thermal comfort for everyone without harming the planet is possible.
This will require a strong focus on passive cooling methods, energy efficiency and phasing out harmful refrigerant gases. These measures can reduce cooling-related emissions by 66 per cent, with the remaining reductions coming from decarbonizing the electricity grid, she said.
The Oxford researcher added that thermal comfort is not just about temperature. It also involves humidity, ventilation, radiant temperature, and clothing insulation. ""Solutions go beyond just switching on one technology,"" she said.
India experienced an exceptionally harsh summer last year, recording 536 heatwave days, the highest in 14 years, according to the India Meteorological Department .
Official data showed that during one of the hottest and longest heat waves, India recorded 41,789 suspected heat stroke cases and 143 heat-related deaths.
This year, the heatwave arrived much earlier than last year. In 2024, Odisha saw its first heatwave on April 5, but in 2025, parts of Konkan and Coastal Karnataka experienced heatwaves as early as February 27-28.
The IMD has forecast above-normal maximum and minimum temperatures across most parts of the country during the summer season which extends from March to May.

"Tariff announcement: Donald Trump to take ‘historic action’ tomorrow to boost American competitiveness, says White House",https://www.livemint.com/economy/trump-tariff-announcement-us-president-vows-historic-action-tomorrow-to-boost-american-competitiveness-white-house-11743526321127.html,"Trump Tariff Announcement: On the eve of Liberation Day, as world economy waits with bated breath anticipating US President's much anticipated Tariff announcement on April 2, White House has vowed ‘historic action’ on what the US President touts as ‘Liberation Day’.
Reciprocal tariffs will take effect immediatelyafter they are announced Wednesday, April 2, while car tariffs (not part of the reciprocal measures) are scheduled to go into effect on April 3.
“My understanding is that the tariff announcement will come tomorrow. They will be effective immediately, and the president has been teasing this for quite some time,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday.
The White House said that President Trump is set to take ‘historic action’ tomorrow, April 2, to improve American competitiveness through new tariff measures.
The White House also announced that products made in America will be exempt from these tariffs.
Currently, President Donald is meeting with his trade and tariff team to finalise details.
A White House spokesperson stated that the President remains open to discussing the tariffs, and several countries have already reached out to initiate conversations on the matter.
US President Donald Trumpon April 2 plans to roll out tariffs on global trading partners during an event planned for 4 pm (I.30 IST) in the White House Rose Garden, the centerpiece of his effort to bring back manufacturing to the US and reshape a world trade system he has long decried as unfair.
On Tuesday, Karoline Leavitt downplayed market volatility ahead of Trump Tariff announcement. Investor fears that tariffs could drive up consumer prices have driven a weeks-long US stock selloff.
“Like they were in his first term, Wall Street will be just fine,” Leavitt said.
On April 1, 2025, both Indian and US markets reacted sharply to the impending announcement of reciprocal tariffs by President Donald Trump, set to take effect on April 2. In India, the stock market experienced a significant downturn, with theSensex plummeting by over 1,390 points and the Nifty falling below 23,200.
This sell-off was driven by investor panic over the potential impact of the tariffs on key sectors such as automotive, textiles, electronics, and IT, with estimates suggesting that Indian exports could face losses of up to $31 billion—nearly 0.8% of India's GDP.
Market sentiment was influenced by global uncertainties, including the impact of US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on April 2.
Meanwhile, on Wall Street, the atmosphere was mixed as investors processed the news. TheDow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.5%, reflecting caution amid fears of escalating trade tensions. The S&P 500 dipped slightly by 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite managed a modest gain of 0.1%, buoyed by some technology stocks.
The overall sentiment was marked by uncertainty as traders braced for the economic implications of the tariffs, which Trump has termed ""Liberation Day"" for American trade.

"India’s crude oil imports rise from Africa, Latin America in February amid US sanctions on Russian supply",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-crude-oil-imports-from-latin-america-africa-rises-in-february-amid-us-sanctions-on-russian-supply-11741863918660.html,"India'scrude oil importsfrom Latin America and Africa rose marginally in February as refiners turned to alternative sources, fearing a loss of Russian oil supplies caused by tighter US sanctions. India became the biggest buyer of Russian seaborne oil sold at a discount after Western nations imposed sanctions on Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
According to news agency Reuters, imports of Russian oil fell three per cent from January to about 1.54 million barrels per day (bpd) in February, with Russia's share in India's overall crude purchases hitting the lowest since January 2024.Oil importsfrom Africa rose to 330,000 bpd in February from 143,000 bpd in January, while those from South America rose 60 per cent to 453,600 bpd.

In January, the US imposed sweeping sanctions targeting Russian producers and tankers, disrupting supply from the world's second-largest producer and tightening ship availability. Russia's share in oil imports by India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, shrank to 30.5 per cent in February, while that of Latin America rose to nine per cent, the highest since December 2021
Last month, India received a rare cargo of Gabon's Etame grade and, for the first time, took Argentina's Medanito oil. According to Reuters, refiners in India maximised the purchase of Russian oil ahead of a February 27 deadline set under the latest US sanctions to settle some energy deals.

About half a dozen vessels loaded with Russian oil arrived at Indian ports towards the end of the month and were discharged in March. A lower intake of Russian oil slightly pushed up the share of oil from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and West African nations in February.
Meanwhile, it was reported that India has spent 112.5 billion euros or about₹1.5 lakh crore on buyingcrude oilfrom Russia since the Ukraine war. According to the European think tank Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), India's payments to Russia for fossil fuels since February 24, 2022, have revealed the figures.

Goenka also seemingly supportedN.R. Narayana Murthy's controversial 70-hour workweek concept, claiming that Murthy and Goyal were not being ‘literal’ but ‘directional’ in their respective statements.
While supporting their statements,Goenkaexplained that the two leaders were simply asking what India is really building through their remarks. ""They were asking: What are we really building? "" Goenka said in his latest post.

Goenka, while rallying behind Murthy's 70-hour work week concept, which caused amajor divide among India Inc leaders earlier this year, also clarified that ‘this is not about glorifying burnout’, but shifting the national mindset.
Amid the latest global tariff war, Goenka has also said that if India wants to compete with the US and China, it needs to build with ambition. The industrialist highlighted sectors such as robotics,artificial intelligence (AI),and energy that ‘move the needle' for India to focus on long-term growth.
Goenka took to the microblogging platform ‘X’ (formerly Twitter) and said in a post on Saturday, April 5,
""When Murthy and Subrahmanyan spoke of 70-90 hour work weeks, and Piyush Goyal questioned startups making vegan ice creams and chasing 10-minute deliveries, they weren’t being literal—they were being directional. They were asking: what are we really building?

While speaking at the Startup Mahakumbh 2025 event on April 3, 2025, Goenka's remarks come after Union MinisterPiyush Goyal slammed Indian billionaire kids for opening ice cream and cookie businessesand calling them startups instead of focusing on the nation's technological growth.
Questioning India's vision for the future, Goyal asked whether or not India wants to focus on tech advancement or if people are satisfied with ice cream brand startups. “Fancy ice cream and cookies. I know at least three or four billionaires whose children make one brand or the other, very fancy ice cream and cookies, and run a very successful business,” said Goyal in his address.
The Union Minister shared his analysis of the startup success stories in India and said, “And I have no complaint against that. But is that the destiny of India? Is the future of India satisfied with that?” Goyal also questioned the strategies of these new and successful startups and said that the brands are using fancy terms and good packaging to call themselves startups in India.

After the heated controversy, D-Street analysts and India Inc. experts soon picked sides for or against the notion. This came after Murthy advocated for a 70-hour workweek last year.
Goenka had expressed his concern about the idea of working 90 hours a week following the L&T chairman's comments on work-life balance. Goenka had stated that with such a practice, why not rename Sunday to ‘Sun-duty’ and make day offs a mythical concept?
“90 hours a week?Why not rename Sunday to ‘Sun-duty’ and make ‘day off’ a mythical concept!Working hard and smart is what I believe in, but turning life into a perpetual office shift?

"Fiscal drag is easing, deregulation poised to spur growth: Neelkanth Mishra",https://www.livemint.com/economy/fiscal-drag-is-easing-deregulation-poised-to-spur-growth-neelkanth-mishra-11743172168538.html,"New Delhi: India’s growth headwinds from the central government’s planned fiscal consolidation are easing, and the currenteconomic slowdownappears cyclical, with the government’s deregulation drive poised to spur growth, Neelkanth Mishra, chief economist at Axis Bank and head of global research at Axis Capital, said on Friday.
Speaking at the Mint India Investment Summit, Mishra said the government was capable of supporting growth and exceeding its deficit targets despite fiscal consolidation.
While government spending in 2023-24 was front-loaded, spending during this financial year has been back-loaded and could drive rapid growth in the final quarter, he added. “It is clear that there was a major drag to growth during FY25, but its impact will ease going forward,” said Mishra.
He added that further rate cuts may be less effective because the Reserve Bank of India has kept liquidity too tight for too long.
RBIkept its key interest rate unchanged at 6.50% for nearly two years, spanning 10 consecutive policy meetings since February 2023. In February this year, however, RBI introduced a 25 basis point cut, bringing the rate down to 6.25%.
To be sure, India’seconomic growthhas slowed from last fiscal year but the country remains the fastest-growing major economy, with real GDP expanding 8.2% in FY24 and projected to grow 6.5% in FY25, according to the National Statistical Office (NSO).
Growth rebounded to 6.2% in the December quarter, up from 5.6% in the preceding three months, driven by increased government spending and festive-season consumption. But achieving the revised full-year GDP expansion target of 6.5% will require 7.6% growth in the final quarter.
Mishra also stressed the need for India to embrace bilateral trade deals globally, as the era of multilateralism wanes, with US reciprocal tariffs set to take effect from 2 April, potentially marking the start of this shift.
“So I think this is the start of a period, a prolonged period of uncertainty,” he said. “However, there is not too much of a threat of US imports coming in, except for maybe some agri commodities and a few others.”
India’s goods exports in April 2024–January 2025 inched up by 1.39% year-on-year to $358.91 billion, while imports grew 7.43% to $601.90 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $22.99 billion as of January 2025, according to commerce ministry data.
Along with slowing global trade and an economic downturn in advanced economies, US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal global tariffs could further disrupt several markets, including India.
As things stand, the US remains one of India's largest trading partners, with bilateral goods trade standing at about $129.2 billion in 2024.
India can't rely on exports as a primary engine for growth for an extended period, Mishra said.
“When you are an economy the size of China or India, net exports can drive growth maybe for a temporary period. This is what happened to China between 2000 and 2008,” he said. “But on a sustainable level, we have to tap into our domestic demand.”
On deregulation, Mishra highlighted significant progress over the past decade and noted that further deregulation, as proposed by the central government in the Budget for 2025-26, would benefit the industry—particularly micro, small and medium enterprises.
He also emphasized that government decision-making had become considerably faster in recent years.
Mishra also said that as the world enters an era of industrial policy competition, the end of multilateralism means that every tool of industrial policy will be deployed globally. These include measures such as weak currencies, labour subsidies, capital subsidies, and directed credit, among others.
“The government then needs to be much leaner and much more focused on the problem areas,” he said.
Citing sectors such as batteries, chemicals, and fertilizers, Mishra said India lags China by 10-15 years, with limited fiscal support and fragmented decision-making across several ministries, making the process inefficient.
Mishra said there were lessons to be learned from the government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes, and that its decision not to renew some of them was appropriate as the schemes often failed to align with their intended objectives.
“But remember that this is also the right message. Unlike some of the earlier incentives which lasted till perpetuity, that you start with an end date, but you don’t stop it. That makes the industry lazy,” he added.
According to a recent Reuters report, the central government has decided not to extend its $23 billion PLI programme, aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and reducing dependence on China, beyond the initial 14 pilot sectors, with no extension of production deadlines despite requests from some participating firms.
Mishra said it would be unwise to expect the US dollar to lose its status as a reserve currency within the next three to five years.
However, over a longer horizon of 15-20 years, he said that a higher likelihood of countries holding reserves in non-dollar assets and a significant portion of global invoicing being conducted in other currencies.

"RBI likely to maintain rate-cut cycle amid global growth challenges and inflation fall, finds HDFC MF report",https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-likely-maintain-rate-cut-cycle-global-growth-challenge-and-less-inflation-hdfc-mutual-fund-report-india-economy-news-11742976435664.html,"India's central bank is likely to continue its rate cut cycle amid global growth challenges and inflation reaching within target levels, according to an HDFC Mutual Fund report.
TheReserve Bank of India's repo rate cuts are expected to continue as risk of headwinds in global growth looms large, especially due to the economic conditions in the United States, it added.
The report noted that whileUS economic growthhas remained relatively stable, recent data points, including Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), consumption spending, and the housing sector, indicate a gradual slowdown.
It said, “Policy uncertainty and escalating trade tensions under the new US administration might weigh on growth over time. Thus, there is increasing risk of global growth momentum decelerating”.
The report raised concerns about whether the period of “US exceptionalism” — a phase of strong economic outperformance — may be fading.
Additionally, policy uncertainty and risingtrade tensionsunder the new US administration could weigh on economic expansion over time, further contributing to global growth concerns.
In this context, the report says that the RBI is expected to continue with the rate-cut cycle to support economic growth. The report adds that inflation is expected to remain close to the central bank's target, aided by stable core inflation and a favorable base effect. These factors provide room for the central bank to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance.
The report said “RBIis likely to continue cutting repo rate as growth is likely to slow down while inflation is expected to durably align closer to target,”
Another key observation in the report is the changing trend in banking credit growth. In the financial year 2023-24 (FY24) and the first half of FY25, bank credit growth was significantly higher than deposit growth. However, this trend has almost converged, which could have implications for overall liquidity in the financial system.
To ensure sufficient liquidity, the RBI has already infused or announced plans to inject approximately₹5.8 trillion since early December 2024. With these measures, durable liquidity in the system is expected to rise to over₹1.5 trillion by the end of FY25.
The central bank's monetarypolicyactions in the coming months will be closely watched, as it balances the need to support economic growth while keeping inflation in check.

Delinquencies expected to increase as student loan forbearance ends
By Nupur Anand
NEW YORK, March 25 (Reuters) - U.S. consumers have been curbing their spending in response to high prices and a worsening economic outlook, according to consumer finance company Synchrony Financial.
Americans have been accumulating more debt amid strain in their finances, with delinquencies edging up for auto loans, credit cards and home credit lines, the Federal Reserve said last month.
Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker has also warned that trouble may be brewing for the U.S. economy, which is showing signs of stress in the consumer sector with consumer confidence also waning.
The belt-tightening indicates that Americans, whose finances are broadly healthy, have been stretching their finances amid persistent inflation, said Max Axler, chief credit officer of Synchrony. Most clients are still keeping up their loan repayments, he added.
""Purchase volumes have gone down across the industry as consumers across all income groups become more thoughtful about spending,"" Axler told Reuters.
Synchrony, which issues credit cards in partnership with retailers and merchants, has more than 100 million consumer credit accounts.
U.S. consumer sentiment plunged to a nearly 2-1/2-year low in March as inflation expectations soared. Some economists have warned that President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs could boost prices and undercut growth.
Concerns about higher prices have driven consumers' long-term inflation expectations to levels last seen in early 1993.
Retailers including Target and Walmart have said that shoppers are being careful with their spending, waiting for deals or making tradeoffs to lower-priced items.
Household spending cuts could be a precursor to increasing late credit payments or loan defaults, analysts said. While default rates have remained broadly steady, spending is being watched carefully as an early indicator of deteriorating consumer finances.
Borrowers could also become more cautious, taking out fewer or smaller loans and crimping a key source of revenue for banks. Across the industry, loan growth slowed by 5% to 12% in February versus a year earlier, HSBC analyst Saul Martinez said.
""There is clearly a slowdown, and it shows that the consumer is vulnerable,"" Martinez said. ""And for banks, slowing loan growth could result in lower net interest income and revenue,"" he added.
The concerns about household finances have also weighed on consumer finance stocks with shares of American Express, Capital One, Synchrony, and Discover down between 15-22% over the past month, Martinez said.
Consumers could also face further strains as the COVID-era student loan service providers began reporting delinquencies through to the credit bureaus from mid-February, with delinquencies as of October 2024 coming through on a rolling basis until May 2025.
""For the first time in five years, federal student loan delinquencies will start to reappear on credit files, and we expect a lot of consumers to be stretched due to this,"" said Rikard Bandebo, Chief Economist at VantageScore.
""We expect delinquencies to go up as a result of it at a time when consumer debt is already high,"" Bandebo added. (Reporting by Nupur Anand in New York, additional reporting by Siddharth Cavale, editing by David Gregorio, Lananh Nguyen and Sandra Maler)

"Trump’s tariffs may knock out $5.67 bn of India’s exports; textiles, kitchenware, footwear may gain",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-exports-trump-tariffs-textiles-kitchenware-footwear-pharma-gems-and-jewellery-seafood-auto-spices-11744009254552.html,"New Delhi: India’s merchandise exports to the US in 2025 may decline by $5.76 billion, or 6.41%, following the imposition of higher tariffs by the Trump administration, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said in a report, with gems and jewellery, marine products, electronics, and auto parts bearing the brunt.
The GTRI analysis, based on 2024 trade data, maps the exposure of Indian goods under the revised US tariff regime, while also factoring in the competitiveness of other exporters such as China, Mexico and Canada. Of $89.81 billion worth of goods shipped from India to the US last year, almost 75%—valued at $67.2 billion—will now be subject to a 26% duty, replacing the much lower most-favoured nation (MFN) tariffs.
The US has been India’s largest export destination for several years, but with tariffs being used as a negotiating tool under US President Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ policy, Indian policymakers face tough choices. While some have called for retaliatory tariffs, the government has so far indicated it will continue to engage through bilateral trade negotiations, as first reported byMinton 4 April.
The new duties are part of a broader strategy to align tariffs with reciprocal market access, and while energy products such as petroleum and solar panels, along with pharmaceuticals, remain exempt, the steep hike across a broad swathe of industrial and consumer goods has made Indian products significantly less competitive.
“The average impact might look modest, but the effect is deeply uneven,” said Ajay Srivastava, co-founder of GTRI. “We’re likely to see sharp declines in some sectors while others may benefit from trade diversion, especially where Chinese goods have been penalised even more heavily.”
The report shows that exports of fish and crustaceans may fall by over 20%, iron and steel items by 18%, and precious stones and jewellery by 15%. Auto parts and electronics are projected to shrink by over 12% each, owing to their high dependence on imported inputs and rising tariff costs in the US.
Gold jewellery and polished diamond exports—worth $11.9 billion last year—are expected to drop by $1.82 billion due to the new 30.2% tariff, significantly reducing the attractiveness of Indian gems in the US market.
""The world is going through profound economic shifts, and the diamond industry is feeling the impact just as much as any other. From changes in global trade dynamics to evolving consumer preferences and tightening financing norms, every link in the value chain is being tested,” said Vipul Shah, former chairman of the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council. “The industry will need to adapt quickly, innovate and find new growth models to stay resilient in this changing environment.""
Electronics and smartphone exports, which had surged to $14.4 billion, are likely to fall by $1.78 billion as the new tariffs of almost 27% eat into already thin margins. India's global value chain dependency in these sectors further weakens its ability to compete with Mexico and Vietnam, which have preferential or duty-free access.
India’s seafood exports to the US are among the worst hit, with frozen fish and shrimp—worth $2 billion in 2024—now facing a 26% tariff after entering duty-free for years. These products account for about a third of India’s global seafood exports. The report projects a 20.2% decline, or $404.3 million loss, especially as Canadian seafood continues to enjoy duty-free access under the USMCA trade pact. Processed meat and fish exports are also affected, with India expected to lose $83.1 million, or 14.2%, as tariffs rise from 2.6% to 31.2%.
Spice exports—especially coffee, tea and related items—valued at $460.8 million, are projected to fall by 13.5%, or $62.2 million. These items earlier faced a nominal 0.2% MFN duty, but now attract a 26.4% tariff, making Indian exports less viable amid competition from Brazil and Colombia.
The report highlights a steep 47.4% tariff on cereals—mainly rice—replacing the earlier 10.7% MFN rate. India exported $427.4 million worth of cereals to the US last year, and this is projected to fall by 12.3%, or $52.6 million. Although Thailand faces higher tariffs, Canada's better trade terms may further disadvantage India in this space.
Even traditional strongholds such as textiles and garments have not been spared from higher duties, but India may still gain market share as rivals face steeper tariffs. While the tariff on knitted garments has shot up to 53.8%, India’s exports in this segment are expected to grow by 3.2% due to favourable pricing and sourcing shifting away from China. Home textiles and made-ups (products including home textiles used in internal space furnishing) could increase 4.2%, helped by India’s position as the second-largest supplier to the US after China.
Pharmaceuticals are among the few sectors where India has escaped the tariff hike, although Trump has said that tariffs on pharma imports will come soon. With zero-duty MFN access continuing, exports in this segment—worth $12.7 billion in 2024—are projected to grow by 2.1%.
However, the report notes that much of this growth hinges on continued low-cost availability of active pharmaceutical ingredients from China and warns that the sector remains vulnerable to any future policy rethink in Washington.
In small industry segments, the picture is mixed. While paper, glass, and ceramic exports face fresh barriers, kitchenware, and footwear may gain modestly as Indian goods remain price competitive.
India’s exports of tools and cutlery could rise by 2.1% despite a 34% tariff, thanks to China’s diminished competitiveness. Footwear exports are expected to grow by 3.1%, albeit from a small base.
GTRI said the estimated impact assumes that all other factors—exchange rates, demand trends, and non-tariff barriers—remain unchanged.
“Many exporters may adapt over time, and some sectors may shift production or revise pricing,” it noted. “But in the short term, the disruption is likely to be real.”
India’s merchandise exports to the US have been on an upward trajectory over recent years. Exports were valued at $75.6 billion in FY22, and this increased to $78.3 billion in FY23, demonstrating a strengthening trade relationship. Although exports dipped to $77.5 billion in FY24 —primarily due to supply chain disruptions—the long-term trend remains positive.

Niti Aayog working on to improve Indias penetration into global value chains for MSMEs growth,https://www.livemint.com/economy/niti-aayog-working-on-to-improve-indias-penetration-into-global-value-chains-for-msmes-growth-11742989447926.html,"New Delhi, Mar 26 (PTI) Niti Aayog is working on a programme to improve India's penetration into global value chains for growth of domestic micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), CEO of the government think-tank B V R Subrahmanyam said on Wednesday.
Observing that MSMEs are more affected by regulations than large companies, he said the prime minister has taken a major step towards deregulation and a task force under the cabinet secretary is working on it.
Subrahmanyam was addressing a gathering after launching 'the Digital Excellence for Growth and Enterprise', or 'Dx-EDGE', a platform to empower MSMEs with the tools, knowledge and ecosystem needed to become future-ready, competitive and resilient.
Dx-EDGE is a national initiative spearheaded by CII with the support of NITI Frontier Tech Hub (NITI FTH) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to drive digital transformation across India's MSMEs.
The Niti Aayog CEO further said it is a fact that some of the big manufacturers have moved to India, and cited the example of mobile phones, terming it as a success story of the PLI (production linked incentive) initiatives.
The other side of the story is, he said, that 95 per cent of what goes into mobile phone manufacturing is being imported.
""...we are working on to get the ecosystem to India. Niti is working on a programme to improve India's penetration of global value chains. To penetrate into global value chains, you need to have the ecosystem here, which means the intermediate routes. They are not final products. They go into some other product. Bulk of global manufacturing is of intermediate products. And who makes these intermediate products, largely MSMEs,"" Subrahmanyam said.
He also said the CII and NITI Frontier Tech Hub Dx-EDGE platform marks a transformative leap in India's digital journey, designed to empower MSMEs with cutting-edge technology and digital mastery.
By establishing a nationwide network of digital transformation facilitation centres, this initiative democratises access to skills and innovation, enabling MSMEs to scale sustainably, enhance global competitiveness, and play a pivotal role in realizing the Viksit Bharat vision, Subrahmanyam said.
Speaking on the occassion, S C L Das, Secretary, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, said that frontier tech, digitalisation and technology have become a necessity to survive the global headwinds and emerging challenges and grow to become a developed nation.
He said that the government has been consistently providing enablers aligned with the national vision of Visit Bharat.
The secretary said that MSMEs have to be at the centre of the journey towards domestic growth, growth of exports, adaptability for climate change, for having the required resilience and technological growth.
Talking about Dx-EDGE, Das said that it is a significant and novel step in the right direction, which has been designed the right way, with Public-Private-Academia Partnership (PPAP).
He said that this particular design approach is going to be the key factor towards its success.
Debjani Ghosh, Distinguished Fellow, NITI Aayog and Chief Architect, NITI FTH, said that future-proofing MSMEs through digital adoption is no longer a luxury – it's a necessity for realising the Viksit Bharat goal.
""With Dx-EDGE, we are building an exciting ecosystem-led approach to empower MSMEs to embrace technology, strengthen resilience and thrive in an increasingly digital world. This initiative is a key pillar of NITI Frontier Tech Hub's vision to accelerate India's transformation into a frontier tech nation, ensuring that no enterprise is left behind in the digital revolution,"" she said.
T G Sitharam, Chairman, AICTE, noted that more and more youth are entering the workforce and underlined the need to create jobs. Underlining India's strength in STEM education, he said that India has delivered engineering and management education to the world.
CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee underlined the significance of MSMEs in the Indian economy and noted that this initiative, Dx-EDGE, will help bridge the gap in technology adoption in the segment.

1 in 5 Ultra-Rich Indians planning to move abroad while retaining citizenship: Report,https://www.livemint.com/economy/1-in-5-ultra-rich-indians-planning-to-move-abroad-while-retaining-citizenship-report-11743062968107.html,"New Delhi [India], March 27 (ANI): One in five ultra-high-net-worth individuals (Ultra-HNIs) in India is either in the process of migrating abroad or planning to do so, while still retaining their Indian citizenship, according to a report by Kotak Bank.
The report highlighted that many of these wealthy individuals plan to settle permanently in their chosen foreign destinations. Among them, professionals show a higher tendency to migrate compared to entrepreneurs or inheritors.
The report said ""1 in 5 Ultra-HNIs surveyed are currently in the process of or plan to migrate, most of whom intend to reside in their chosen host country permanently while retaining their Indian citizenship"".
Additionally, those aged between 36-40 years and those above 61 years are more likely to consider relocation than others in different age groups.
The findings come at a time when India's ultra-rich population and overall wealth are projected to witness significant growth. The number of Ultra-HNIs in the country is expected to rise to 4.3 lakh by 2028.
The report added ""India Ultra-HNI numbers and wealth is expected to grow to reach 4,30,000 with a total wealth of₹359 trillion by 2028"".
As their wealth grows, more Ultra-HNIs are looking beyond India's borders for investment opportunities. The report notes that nearly one-third of India's ultra-rich now hold global assets, with a significant focus on residential real estate.
Many of these individuals see property investments as part of their long-term migration and residency plans abroad.
The desire to migrate is not a new trend. In 2021, the Ministry of External Affairs reported that over 2.5 million Indians migrate to other countries every year. India also has one of the largest diasporas in the world, with over 32 million Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) settled across the globe.
Many among them have excelled in various fields, making significant contributions to their adopted countries with their skills and expertise.
With Ultra-HNIs increasingly diversifying their wealth globally, their migration decisions are influenced by better investment opportunities, stronger financial security, and long-term residency benefits in foreign countries. (ANI)

Forex rate disclosures: ICAI supports change suggested by audit watchdog NFRA,https://www.livemint.com/economy/icai-nfra-accounting-norm-revision-foreign-currency-operations-11741353768115.html,"The accounting profession’s self-regulator and rule-maker, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), has backed audit watchdog National Financial Reporting Authority’s (NFRA) proposal to revise reporting norms for foreign currency operations, saying it will bring more clarity.
The amendments are proposed to apply from annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2025, according to the NFRA.
NFRA’s board had last month decided to recommend to the ministry of corporate affairs to notify amendments to accounting standard Ind AS 21 dealing with ‘effects of changes in foreign exchange rates’. Under the provision, financial reporting of operations in countries with extreme economic conditions such as hyperinflation, government controls or official exchange rates not reflecting market realities have to make more disclosures about their accounting approach,Mintreported on 5 March.
For example, Argentina’s peso in recent years saw extreme fluctuations and the government is planning to lift its strict currency controls by next year.
Amendments to the accounting standard enable businesses to translate their operations in currencies in restricted environments into the reporting currency and capture their financial position more accurately.
ICAI’s new president Charanjot Singh Nanda said the proposed amendments provide useful information to the users of financial statements.
Ind AS 21, as it exists today, specifies the exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when exchangeability between the two currencies is temporarily lacking. But it does not specify such a rate when a lack of exchangeability is not temporary, Nanda said. Therefore, the provision had a limited guidance in this regard, he said.
“Through these proposed amendments, comprehensive guidance has been added regarding lack of exchangeability, whether temporary or not. Amendments require an entity to apply a consistent two-step approach to assess whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency and, when it is not, to determining the spot exchange rate to use and the disclosures to provide,” said Nanda.
The move is significant for countries facing economic turbulence, affecting currency exchangeability.
Nanda’s comments show the ICAI and the NFRA are on the same page on this matter after the institute flagged its difference of opinion last year about revising another controversial auditing standard—SA600.
It deals with the audit of group financial statements in which the parent company’s auditor uses the work of subsidiaries’ auditors.
ICAI had said NFRA should halt the move to amend SA600 for more consultations. NFRA’s proposal to amend SA600 is pending with the ministry of corporate affairs.
Meanwhile, the revision of Ind AS 21 comes after a similar change globally, which is effective from annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025 although its earlier application was allowed.
The amended global norms introduce specific criteria to assess the exchangeability of the currency and determine an appropriate exchange rate when it is lacking, explained CA Chintan Vajani of chartered accountancy firm KMP NPV Associates LLP.
It also mandated disclosure to provide the reason for the lack of exchangeability, the rate used, and the estimation method applied, along with the impact of using an alternative rate, he said.

"Need to build reliable, resilient supply chains, says EAM Jaishankar",https://www.livemint.com/economy/need-to-build-reliable-resilient-supply-chains-says-eam-jaishankar-11742465423036.html,"New Delhi, India March 20 (ANI): External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said that we need to build reliable and resilient supply chains, as the world is passing through an uncertain and volatile period.
Addressing the 10th CII India-LAC Business Conclave, Jaishankar said, ""We are passing through an uncertain and volatile period... We are all developing countries and, therefore, among those most impacted by the long-term consequences of the COVID pandemic.""
""On top of that, the implications of the Ukraine conflict for food, fuel and fertiliser security have been additional stress points... The cost of borrowing, particularly for developing countries, has been exorbitant. This challenging backdrop is the reality that we must recognise as we explore new forms of cooperation... There is a need to de-risk the global economy from the dangers of over-concentration in any single geography. But we also need to build reliable and resilient supply chains,"" he said.
Jaishankar added that India's collaboration with Latin America and the Caribbean must address the needs of health security.
The Union Minister said that facilitating technology flows, harmonising regulations, recognising pharmacopoeia, and promoting mobility of talent are among the possibilities that we should encourage...
""Now, both COVID and conflict have brought home to us the importance of food security... Latin America and the Caribbean have the ability to serve as a breadbasket, not just for themselves but for the entire world. To realise their full potential, there is a need for better technology, greater productivity, logistics, post-harvest storage, and more food processing... The quest for energy security ranks only next to health and food security,"" he added.
During his address, the Union Minister highlighted the potential for collaboration in health, food and energy security. He also emphasised the importance of mining, infrastructure and Defence as domains to be further explored.
The minister further said that innovation and startups can help build more bridges. He said that development partnerships with the LAC region will continue to deliver. (ANI)

Knight Frank India mentioned with the US dollar strengthening, the relative affordability of these cities has improved in USD terms, enabling buyers to acquire more space compared to 2014.
“In contrast, prime property price growth in Delhi and Bengaluru stood at 13% and 14%, respectively, making them more affordable for global buyers,""HTquoted Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director of Knight Frank India, as saying.
Though prime international markets saw an average price surge of 3.6 percent in 2024,Indian cities continue establishing themselves as competitive playersin the global luxury real estate landscape, he added.

US Consumer Borrowing Growth Slows After Near-Record Surge,https://www.livemint.com/economy/us-consumer-borrowing-growth-slows-after-near-record-surge-11741405089746.html,"US consumers dialed back the pace of borrowing in February after a near-record increase a month earlier.
Total credit increased $18.1 billion in January after a revised $37.1 billion jump in December, according to Federal Reserve data out Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a $14.9 billion advance.
Outstanding credit-card and other revolving debt climbed $9 billion. Non-revolving credit, such as loans for vehicle purchases and school tuition, advanced by a similar amount. Both were decelerations from the prior month.
Stubborn inflation, high borrowing costs and the end of pandemic savings continue to take a toll on household finances. Data earlier Friday showed the labor market softened last month as unemployment rose, setting a weak backdrop just as President Donald Trump’s policies raise concerns about the broader economy.
Separate government showed last week US consumers unexpectedly pulled back on spending at the start of the year — though extreme winter weather in some parts of the country likely played a part.
Even so, Fed policymakers have indicated they’ll keep interest rates steady until there’s more progress on taming inflation, which presents another headwind for Americans holding higher balances on credit cards and other loans.
A record share of consumers is now only making the minimum payment on their credit cards, and car owners are missing their monthly loan payments at the highest rate in more than 30 years. The share of outstanding US consumer debt that’s in delinquency rose at the end of 2024 to the highest in almost five years, according to the New York Fed.

India’s forex reserves rise USD 305 million to USD 654.3 billion last week,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-forex-reserves-rise-usd-305-million-to-usd-654-3-billion-last-week-11742715914585.html,"New Delhi [India], March 23 (ANI): India's foreign exchange reserves rose USD 305 million to USD 654.271 billion in the week that ended on March 14.
The previous week witnessed the highest weekly gains in over three years.
Prior to that, forex reserves had slumped for about four months, recently hitting an 11-month low. Then followed the latest rollercoaster movement, with gains some weeks and declines the next.
Forex reserves started falling after touching an all-time high of USD 704.89 billion in September. They are now about 7 percent lower from their peak.
The decline in reserves was most likely due to RBI intervention, aimed at preventing a sharp depreciation of the Rupee. The Indian Rupee is now at or near its all-time low against the US dollar.
The latest RBI data showed that India's foreign currency assets (FCA), the largest component of forex reserves, stood at USD 557.186 billion.
Gold reserves currently amount to USD 74.391 billion, according to RBI data.
Estimates suggest that India's foreign exchange reserves are sufficient to cover approximately 10-11 months of projected imports.
In 2023, India added around USD 58 billion to its foreign exchange reserves, contrasting with a cumulative decline of USD 71 billion in 2022. In 2024, the reserves rose by a little over USD 20 billion.
Foreign exchange reserves, or FX reserves, are assets held by a nation's central bank or monetary authority, primarily in reserve currencies such as the US Dollar, with smaller portions in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling.
The RBI often intervenes by managing liquidity, including selling dollars, to prevent steep Rupee depreciation. The RBI strategically buys dollars when the Rupee is strong and sells when it weakens. (ANI)

"Moderate US consumer spending, increasing prices raise specter of stagflation",https://www.livemint.com/economy/moderate-us-consumer-spending-increasing-prices-raise-specter-of-stagflation-11743181274174.html,"*
Consumer spending increases 0.4% in February

PCE price index rises 0.3%; up 2.5% year-on-year

Core PCE inflation climbs 0.4%; rises 2.8% year-on-year

Inflation expectations deteriorate sharply in March
By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON, - U.S. consumer spending rebounded less than expected in February while a measure of underlying prices increased by the most in 13 months, stoking fears the economy was facing a period of tepid growth and high inflation amid an escalation in trade tensions.
Those concerns were reinforced by a survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showing consumers' 12-month inflation expectations soared to the highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years in March. Even more worrisome, consumers anticipated inflation would remain elevated in the years beyond.
Economists say President Donald Trump's protectionist trade agenda, marked by a rush of tariff action announcements since taking office in January, will boost prices of imported goods and drive inflation higher in the coming months.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged last week that inflation had started to rise ""partly in response to tariffs,"" adding that ""there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.""
While Powell downplayed the deteriorating inflation expectations, economists said hot underlying price pressures could deter the U.S. central bank from resuming cutting interest rates in June as anticipated by financial markets.
""Today's data is only inflaming stagflation fears,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. ""We are moving in the wrong direction and the concern is that tariffs threaten higher prices, which mean the inflation prints are going to remain hot. This will constrain the Fed's ability to deliver further interest rate cuts.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, climbed 0.4% after a downwardly revised 0.3% decline in January, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending gaining 0.5% after a previously reported 0.2% fall in January.
Spending was lifted by a 1.4% surge in outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods like motor vehicles and parts, recreational goods and vehicles as well as furniture and other durable household equipment. Spending on nondurable goods such as food and beverages also rose.
But consumers are pulling back on discretionary spending. Outlays on services edged up 0.2%, with receipts at restaurants, hotels and motels dropping 15.0%.
""Consumers are clearly becoming more tactical and cautious in their spending as they try to navigate this uncertain economic and inflationary environment,"" said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Spending at nonprofit institutions plunged 15.8% amid federal funding cuts as the Trump administration embarks on an unprecedented campaign to sharply downsize the government.
Trump this week unveiled a 25% levy on imported cars and light trucks starting next week. Economists say the size and manner in which the tariffs are being handled were detrimental to economic growth.
They have also criticized the often disorderly firings of thousands of federal workers by tech billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Many workers have been ordered reinstated by courts.
U.S. stocks traded lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
TRADE WAR
With the United States' trade partners expected to retaliate through duties of their own, the risks of stagflation or worse, a recession, have increased.
The well-telegraphed tariffs have sharply widened the trade deficit as businesses rushed to secure imports. Trump, who sees tariffs as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised tax cuts and to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base, is planning to unveil a wave of reciprocal tariffs next week.
Economists, however, argue that the duties will be inflationary, a sentiment shared by consumers.
Consumers' one-year inflation expectations jumped to 5.0% in March, the highest level since November 2022, the University of Michigan survey showed. That compared to 4.3% last month.
Over the next five years, they saw inflation running at 4.1%, the highest reading since February 1993 and up from 3.5% in February. ""Inflation expectations are the transmission mechanism in which a one-time hit to the price level from tariffs turn into a general increase across the price level or inflation,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US.
""A rational fiscal policymaker would look at the tone and tenor of the hard and soft data and conclude it's time to start cutting trade deals to limit the damage to the real economy.""
The BEA report showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index increased 0.3% in February after advancing by the same unrevised margin in January and in line with economists' expectations.
There were increases in the prices of recreational goods and vehicles, and other durable goods as well as clothing and footwear. Services prices rose solidly, driven by higher costs for housing, recreation and finance.
In the 12 months through February, PCE prices increased 2.5%, matching January's rise.
Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.4% in February. That was the biggest gain in the so-called core inflation since January 2024 and followed an unrevised 0.3% advance in January.
In the 12 months through February, core inflation increased 2.8% after rising 2.7% in January.
The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. It last week left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.50% range.
Following the auto tariffs, J.P. Morgan raised its core PCE inflation estimate this year to 3.1% from 2.8%.
""We see much of this increase concentrated in the second quarter,"" said Michael Feroli, J.P. Morgan's chief U.S. economist. ""The resulting squeeze on consumer real purchasing power will further weigh on real consumer spending.""
Consumer spending adjusted for inflation edged up 0.1% after declining 0.6% in January. That suggested consumer spending and economic growth could stall this quarter.
Goldman Sachs cut its gross domestic product estimate to a 0.6% annualized rate from a 1.0% pace. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP contracting at a 2.8% rate. The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the October-December quarter.
""This report increases the chances that first-quarter real GDP growth will print with a negative sign,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.

"Trump tariffs: India may have competitive edge over China, Vietnam in solar equipment exports to US",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-competitive-advantage-edge-solar-exports-us-china-vietnam-11743666431832.html,"New Delhi: Indian solar equipment makers may have a competitive advantage over their rivals in China and Vietnam after US President Donald Trump announced his promised reciprocal trade tariffs on almost all countries.
Although the tariffs will increase costs for US power generators that import solar equipment and may impact the sales of exporters, India may have an edge due to the lower tariff imposed on Indian products.
The US imposed a 27% additional tariff on Indian exports, while the tariffs on China and Vietnam are 34% and 46%, respectively. The current tariff rate on Indian solar exports stands at 14%.
While the details are yet to be outlined for the tariffs imposed by the US, the initial analysis seems to show a comparatively better situation for Indian solar manufacturers than other global suppliers, Ashwani Sehgal, president of the Indian Solar Manufacturers Association, toldMint.
""It seems that as the tariff imposed on Indian products is lower than that imposed on China and Vietnam, the major suppliers of modules and cells. India seems to have an edge over its counterparts. This is just the initial assessment and the details, which would be released on 9 April, would give a better picture of the likely impact,"" Sehgal said.
India exported $1.96 billion worth of solar modules in FY24, with $1.93 billion—almost its entire export volume—going to the US. China remains the global leader, with total module exports valued at $49 billion in 2023, dwarfing India’s export figures.
The tariffs, however, would make Indian supplies much more expensive than solar equipment produced in the US. The imposition of tariffs on Indian solar modules could significantly impact the industry, the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) noted in a report in February.
""The export market for Indian solar manufacturers could shrink dramatically due to price disadvantages. For instance, Indian manufacturers are currently selling TOPCon solar modules (manufactured with imported cells) to the US at around USD 0.30 per Watt-peak (Wp), compared to USD 0.17-0.19 per Wp domestically,"" it said, adding that the tariffs would further inflate these prices in the US market, worsening the disadvantage.
Data from CEEW showed that India’s solar module exports accounted for 4.7% of US solar imports in Q1 of 2024, compared with 87% for Southeast Asian countries, where many factories are Chinese owned. While US anti-dumping duties on these imports (up to 271 per cent) create an opportunity for Indian manufacturers, the new reciprocal tariff could erode their competitiveness.
Indian companies including Waaree Energies have local manufacturing capacity.
In February,Mintreported that India is pursuing direct government-to-government engagements with African and West Asian nations to open new markets for Indian green energy companies and solar equipment manufacturers, beyond the US.
India's current solar module manufacturing capacity stands at 74 GW, while that for solar cells is 9 GW.

China State Banks Plan Placements of $72 Billion to Add Capital,https://www.livemint.com/economy/china-state-banks-plan-placements-of-72-billion-to-add-capital-11743325340258.html,"Four of China’s largest state banks plan a total of up to $72 billion in private placements to boost core tier-1 capital, after Beijing pushed for stronger buffers for lenders to better support the economy.
Bank of Communications Co. will sell up to 120 billion yuan of A shares in a private placement to investors including the Ministry of Finance, according to a Sunday filing. Bank of China Ltd., Postal Savings Bank of China Ltd. and China Construction Bank Corp. plan placements of 165 billion yuan, 130 billion yuan and 105 billion yuan worth of A shares respectively to the finance ministry and other investors, according to separate filings.
China’s finance ministry is a major shareholder in all of the state lenders.
The announcements follow Chinese authorities’ pledge in early March to issue 500 billion yuan in special sovereign bonds to replenish capital at the nation’s biggest state-owned banks. The plan to help out the lenders was first flagged as far back as September and the government later said it would tap the notes to fund the injections.
China is beefing up the strength of its banking system — even though the top six lenders have capital levels that exceed requirements — after enacting a string of stimulus policies including cuts to mortgage and policy rates.
Enlisted to support the economy over the past few years, the lenders are battling record-low margins, slowing profit growth and rising bad debt. The sector’s net interest margin — a gauge of profitability — had slipped to 1.52% at end-2024, the lowest ever.
Stronger capital buffers will allow lenders to potentially provide more loans as Beijing vowed greater support for sectors from property to consumer and technology to achieve a growth target of about 5% this year. It’ll also serve China’s purpose to maintain financial stability and keep risks in check, while it contends with both domestic woes and tariff shocks from the US.

"India’s GDP growth to surpass 6.5 per cent in FY26, one of the fastest rates among large economies: Moody’s",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-gdp-growth-to-surpass-6-5-per-cent-in-fy26-one-of-the-fastest-rates-among-large-economies-moodys-11741766778499.html,"Higher government capex and a boost in consumption will fuel India's economic growth in FY26, exceeding 6.5 per cent in the next fiscal, Moody's ratings said on Wednesday.
If the trends sustain, the uptick will be significantly higher from 6.3 per cent this fiscal.
The ratings agency commented that India's economic growth is poised to be one of the fastest among large economies, following a temporary slowdown in 2024.
“Government capital expenditure, tax cuts for middle-class income groupsto boost consumption and monetary easing will help India's real GDP growth exceed 6.5% for fiscal 2025-26 from 6.3% in fiscal 2024-25,” Moody's Ratings said.
Projecting a stable outlook for the banking sector, Moody's said although the operating environment of Indian banks will remain favourable in the next fiscal, their asset quality will deteriorate moderately after substantial improvements in recent years, with some stress in unsecured retail loans, microfinance loans and small business loans.
Banks' profitability will remain adequateas declines in net interest margins (NIMs) are likely to be marginal amid modest rate cuts, it said.
The finance ministry's Economic Survey has projected GDP growth for next fiscal at 6.3-6.8 per cent. As per official estimates, GDP growth in the current fiscal would be 6.5 per cent.
The country's real GDP growth slowed to 5.6 per cent in the July-September 2024 quarter before rebounding to 6.2 per cent in the following quarter.
Moody's expects India's average inflation rate to decline to 4.5 per cent in fiscal 2025-26 from 4.8 per cent in the previous year.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised its policy rate by 250 basis points from May 2022 to February 2023 to tame inflation, which has gradually led to increases in interest rates for borrowers.
TheRBI lowered its policy rate by 25 basis pointsto 6.25 per cent in February 2025.
""We expect further rate cuts to be modest, as the central bank takes a cautious stance amid global uncertainty around US trade policies, as well as associated market and exchange rate volatility, as represented by a strengthening of the US dollar against emerging market currencies in late 2024 and early 2025,"" Moody's said.
We expect system-wide loan growth to slow to 11-13 per cent in fiscal 2025-26 from an average of 17 per cent for March 2022-March 2024 as banks seek to keep loan growth in tandem with deposit expansion, Moody's said.

Israel’s Central Bank Chief Criticizes Netanyahu’s Budget,https://www.livemint.com/economy/israels-central-bank-chief-criticizes-netanyahu-s-budget-11742992437052.html,"Israel’s central bank governor criticized the government’s budget, which was approved by parliament on Tuesday, saying it will fail to bring down debt quickly enough after a surge induced by 18 months of war.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s spending plan takes “significant convergence measures this year, mainly on the revenue side,” Governor Amir Yaron said in comments published on Wednesday. These, he said, “will roughly offset the increase in fixed expenditures deriving from the war.”
“However, these measures are not enough to ensure a sustained decline” in Israel’s ratio of debt to gross domestic product, Yaron said in a central bank report. That’s because some of those measures are “temporary and also due to the expected increase in structural government expenditures.”
Yaron, who’s also the government’s chief economic advisor, has frequently urged it to focus more on controlling Israel’s finances since Hamas’s attack in October 2023, which triggered a multi-front conflict with Iran-backed militias. He’s criticized Netanyahu’s coalition, the most right-wing in Israel’s history, for prioritizing religious causes over moves to boost economic growth.
“There was room for improvement in the budget composition, with an emphasis on investing in long-term growth engines, improving productivity and the education system, and reducing negative incentives to go to work,” Yaron said.
Israel’s spending and borrowing have soared since the war began, leading to several credit-rating downgrades. The economy grew at the slowest pace in over two decades last year, barring the Covid-19 pandemic. That was mainly due to labor shortages resulting from a ban on Palestinian workers entering to Israel and a mass call up of military reservists. Sectors such as tech, construction, and agriculture all suffered.
“Th economy has not yet returned to its pre-war state, and war repercussions will continue to affect it for many years to come,” Yaron said in the report.
Israel’s economy got a respite with a ceasefire in Lebanon in November and one with Hamas in mid-January. The breakdown of the latter in the past two weeks and resumption of conflict of Gaza have put pressure on Israeli assets. The shekel is down 2.8% against the dollar in the past month, making it the worst performer globally after the Turkish lira, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The 120-seat Israeli parliament, or Knesset, approved the budget by 66 votes to 52. Opposition figures who rejected it made similar arguments as Yaron.
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said it was a program that would “support growth and allow the economy to maintain strength and prosperity.”
The 620 billion shekel budget sets deficit target of 4.9% of GDP, lower than last year’s figure of 6.8%. It has a package of fiscal adjustments worth 35 billion shekels that includes new taxes and some spending cuts.
Israel’s debt to GDP ratio rose to 68% last year, it’s highest in over a decade.
“The long-term consequences of the war are not limited to fiscal measures,” Yaron said. “They may also be reflected over time in the economy’s risk premium and credit rating.”

"‘Will be amazed if recession can be avoided’, says Jim Walker, the economist who predicted 2008 US market crash",https://www.livemint.com/economy/will-be-amazed-if-recession-can-be-avoided-says-jim-walker-the-economist-who-predicted-2008-us-market-crash-11742833383553.html,"Aletheia Capital's Chief Economist Jim Walker highlighted in a research report released on Monday, March 24, that he would be amazed if the US economy could avoid the upcoming potential recession.
“In the US itself, we will be amazed if recession can be avoided, especially if efforts to cap fiscal expenditure are successful,” he said in the report.
In the report titled “Peregrinations Walking All Over The World”, Jim Walker and Wayne Choi highlighted that the inflation signals in the US are not good, which may prompt a situation of stagflation in the US economy.
Stagflation is a slowing growth curve fuelled by higher unemployment and rising prices in a country. US inflation data eased to 2.8 per cent in February 2025, compared to its January 3 per cent levels.
“That said, inflation signals are not good so perhaps the right call is for stagflation. Predicting interest rate moves in this environment is like spinning a roulette wheel – a game of pure chance,” according to the Aletheia Capital report.
The chief economist also highlighted that real gross fixed capital formation spending terms have been the main driving factor for the recoveries of major economies such as the United States, India and Singapore.
On the topic of President Donald Trump's tariffs, the economist expects that their effect will not be limited to the export sectors but also the domestic investment of the nation.
Jim Walker was among those who predicted the 2008 financial crisis in the US economy and is recently back in action after acknowledging in a commentary that he would be amazed if the US avoided the potential recession.
Walker has worked for more than six years for Aletheia Capital, an independent advisory firm based in Hong Kong. Earlier, Walker was a Senior Economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland before venturing into the private sector.
Jim Walker holds a PhD in economics from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland.
In a recent interview with the news portalET Now, Jim Walker flagged the potential for the US economy to experience a 2008-like situation, which led to an economic crash.
“It will be a pretty painful slowdown, but we can go to the other end of it without the kind of government and central bank action that took place in 2008, 2009,” Walker was quoted as saying in the report.

"We have pre-paid large chunk of high-cost govt debt, to help state borrowings: FM",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-debt-pre-payment-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-supplementary-demand-parliament-11741711071767.html,"New Delhi:The government has pre-paid a large chunk of its high-cost debt this financial year with a favourable effect to the borrowing cost of Central and state governments, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Tuesday.
Replying to the debate in Lok Sabha on the second ‘supplementary demands for grants’ for FY25 presented on Monday, Sitharaman said that the request to Parliament involved what is called 'technical supplementary demands' of over₹6.27 trillion.
These are spending plans financed by savings or extra revenue receipts and do not entail net cash outgo to the exchequer.
The minister said that of this,₹5.54 trillion went for re-payment ofdebt. That included a buy-back of over₹85,150 crore of government securities under market loans and redemption of₹98,745 crore of 91-day treasury bills and₹four trillion of 14-day treasury bills, the document presented in Parliament showed.

“Essentially we are removing the high-cost debt from our shoulders by advance redemption in those debts,” Sitharaman said.
“I'm glad to say to this House, many members would have noticed that because we have done this redemption, the borrowing rates for government have come down. When states go to the market with their bonds, their rates also will be far less. So, it is a constant endeavor to make sure that we do not have excess demand,” said the minister.
The government now presents only two additional spending requests to Parliament, unlike the earlier practice of presenting three supplementary demands for grants. The idea is to follow fiscal discipline.

Responding to Revolutionary Socialist Party MP N.K. Premachandran’s comment that over₹6 trillion of technical supplementary demands was huge, Sitharaman said that₹5.5 trillion went for repayment of debts.
Debt management is a very dynamic process and it aims to reduce the cost of borrowing for both the both the Union and the states, a task that needs flexibility, the minister said.
The government’s additional spending plan involved a net cash outgo of₹51,463 crore in FY25 to meet the funding requirements of mainly fertilizer, food and cooking gas subsidy and defence pension, Mint reported on Monday.

As per latest reports, India, Israel and Vietnam are seeking to fast-track trade talks, with Donald Trump personally involved in finalising agreements ahead of a looming tariff deadline.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit the White House on Monday, Axios reported, citing four sources with knowledge of the matter.
The report added that if the visit takes place as planned, the Israeli leader would be the first foreign leader to meet with US President Donald Trump in person to try to negotiate a deal to remove tariffs.
On Friday, US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio discussed tariffs with Benjamin Netanyahu, reported Reuters. Israel currently faces a 17 per cent tariff from the Trump ruled country.
Earlier, Donald Trump, on his social media platform Truth Social, said that the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam mentioned that the country wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the US.
In addition to the baseline tariff of 10%, India faces a 26% tariffs on exports from the nation.
Starting today, a 10% base tariff will be implemented, while a flat 26% country-specific duty for India will take effect next Wednesday, April 9.
The Indian government has stated that it is ""carefully examining"" the impact of the tariffs announced by Trump on April 2.
The Commerce Ministry is evaluating the situation in consultation with stakeholders, gathering feedback from exporters, and exploring potential opportunities arising from the tariff changes, stated reports.
As per CNN, Trump is ""actively negotiating"" trade deals with India, Vietnam, and Israel.

Parliament passes Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill to allow 4 nominees in bank a/c,https://www.livemint.com/economy/parliament-passes-banking-laws-amendment-bill-to-allow-4-nominees-in-bank-ac-11742994917466.html,"New Delhi, Mar 26 (PTI) Parliament on Wednesday passed the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which allows bank account holders to have up to four nominees, with the Rajya Sabha approving it by a voice vote.
Lok Sabha had passed The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill in December 2024.
Another change in the bill relates to redefining of term 'substantial interest' of a person in a bank. The limit is sought to be enhanced to₹2 crore from the current₹5 lakh, which was fixed almost six decades ago.
The bill was passed by a voice vote in the upper house.
Replying to a debate on the bill in Rajya Sabha, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that even though NPAs have decreased drastically, the government is committed to taking stringent action against wilful defaulters.
She said in the last five years, the Directorate of Enforcement has taken up around 112 cases related to bank fraud, including those pertaining to wilful defaulters.

IMF cautioned of systemic risks in India’s NBFC sector due to high exposure to power and infrastructure sector,https://www.livemint.com/economy/imf-cautioned-of-systemic-risks-in-india-s-nbfc-sector-due-to-high-exposure-to-power-and-infrastructure-sector-11741082034026.html,"New Delhi [India], March 4 (ANI): The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns about potential financial instability in India due to the concentrated exposure of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) to the power and infrastructure sector.
The report highlights that NBFCs are deeply interconnected with banks, corporate bond markets, and mutual funds, which could amplify systemic stress if vulnerabilities emerge.
The IMF report specifically warns about the high exposure of NBFCs to the power sector, which continues to face structural challenges.
Concentrated lending to this sector increases the risk of financial instability, as any distress in power and infrastructure projects could trigger broader stress across banks, bond markets, and mutual funds.
Furthermore, the co-lending model, where banks partner with NBFCs to extend credit to priority sectors, further intertwines financial institutions, increasing systemic risk.
The IMF suggests closer monitoring of NBFCs' lending patterns and improved risk management frameworks to prevent financial disruptions.
The report raises concern that while NBFCs function similarly to banks in many ways, key differences remain. Unlike banks, NBFCs cannot accept demand deposits, and their deposits are not insured.
They also do not have access to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) liquidity facilities or payment systems. The IMF recommends strengthening liquidity regulations for NBFCs, particularly those with significant infrastructure exposure.
Additionally, India's corporate bond market remains underdeveloped, making NBFCs heavily reliant on domestic institutions like banks and mutual funds for financing. This interconnectedness has led to past liquidity crises, with major redemptions in the mutual fund industry linked to corporate bond market distress.
Despite these challenges, India has made significant progress in financial inclusion. The IMF notes that nearly 80 per cent of adults have financial accounts, supported by extensive banking networks and the growth of digital public infrastructure such as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
The rapid rise of retail investors in equities has also transformed India into one of the world's largest markets for equity options trading.
India's financial system is diverse and well-developed, with total assets amounting to nearly 190 per cent of GDP. While banks hold around 60 per cent of the financial system's assets, NBFCs have expanded their market share significantly.
Nearly half of the credit to the private sector now comes from non-banking financial institutions, including insurers, pension funds, and investment funds.
The IMF notes that state-owned NBFCs dominate the sector, with the top three government-owned infrastructure financing companies (IFCs) holding one-third of total NBFC assets. Unlike private-sector NBFCs, state-owned entities are currently exempt from large exposure limits, raising regulatory concerns.
The report recommends aligning regulations for both state-owned and private NBFCs to mitigate risks. (ANI)

Large-scale Holi celebrations will take place across Delhi and the entire country this year, leading to a high demand for venues like banquet halls, farmhouses, hotels, restaurants, and public parks, most of which have been fully booked.
Khandelwal said that over 3,000 Holi Milan celebrations of varying scales are being organised in Delhi alone by business, social, cultural, and religious bodies.
Like other years, traders and customers during this year's Holi shopping have boycotted Chinese goods, Khandelwal said.

"‘India will reduce tariffs substantially’, declares Donald Trump during Oval Office briefing on eve of ’Liberation Day’",https://www.livemint.com/economy/donald-trump-claims-india-will-reduce-tariff-substantially-ahead-of-reciprocal-tariff-declaration-on-april-2-11743502175761.html,"“India is going to be dropping its tariffs very substantially,” US President Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday, a day ahead of his much-anticipated 'Liberation Day' reciprocal tariff announcements. Speaking to the media in the White House Oval Office, Trump observed that “we help everybody, and they don’t help us”.
Donald Trump's ‘Liberation Day’ reciprocal tariff announcement move has put the world markets in a chokehold as companies and countries brace for the implications of the US tariff announcement.
Talking to reporters,President Donald Trump stated that India would soon reduce its tariffs,contemplating, “Why didn't somebody do this a long time ago.”
The US president backed his India tariff reduction claim by citing ‘US pressure’ and ongoing bilateral trade negotiations aimed at addressing the trade imbalance and enhancing market access.
Donald Trump has criticised India for imposing ""massive"" and ""restrictive"" tariffs on American products, calling India the ""tariff king"" and accusing it of unfair trade practices.
“We help everybody, and they don’t help us,”Donald Trumpcomplained at his Oval Office to reporters, voicing his spartan win-or-lose philosophy on Monday.
Following weeks of aggressive rhetoric on tariffs, punctuated by last-minute reversals and subsequent renewed threats, the imposition of import penalties aimed at impacting America's allies, such as Canada and Mexico, has left everyone uncertain about what might come next.
WillDonald Trump impose across-the-board matching tariffson nations that use protectionism against US exports? Or will the president simply target all goods coming into the country? Or will Trump take a nation-by-nation approach designed to grind out new bilateral arrangements?
The imposition of stringent tariffs, a policy tool that historically played a role in shaping the foreign andeconomic policies of the United States, is primarily aimed at safeguarding domestic industries.
By increasing the cost of imported goods, tariffs render foreign products less competitive in the domestic market, thereby protecting local businesses and promoting economic self-sufficiency.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday highlighted several examples of what theTrump administrationconsiders unfair trade practices.
Speaking to the reporters, Leavitt noted:
""This makes it virtually impossible for American products to be imported to these markets and has put a lot of Americans out of business and work over the past several decades,"" she said.
She added, ""It's time for reciprocity. It's time for the president to make a historic change and do what's right for the American people"".

"Indian states tap short-term funds as long-term yields harden, analysts say",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indian-states-tap-short-term-funds-as-long-term-yields-harden-analysts-say-11741681616705.html,"By Dharamraj Dhutia
MUMBAI, March 11 (Reuters) - Some Indian states and a large government-run firm are issuing short-term bonds to fulfill their funding requirements as yields on long-term notes have risen.
At an auction on Tuesday, Indian states will raise 495 billion rupees ($5.7 billion) through bonds, of which 28% will be via notes maturing within six years.
Such bonds accounted for a mere 3.4% of states' borrowing at the other auctions in the January-to-March quarter.
""With the central bank rate cut cycle continuing, we expect long-term yields to come down in the next year, while better demand for shorter duration segment would also have nudged states to go for lower tenor bonds this week,"" said Alok Sharma, head of treasury at ICBC.
The spread between India's 10-year benchmark bond yield and similar maturity state debt has risen to the highest in more than a year. The 10-year state bond yields jumped to their highest in over seven months last week.
Fixed income market participants expect India's central bank to cut the policy rate by another 50 basis points over the coming months, after it kick-started the easing cycle in February with a 25 bps reduction, which was its first cut in nearly five years.
The 10-year benchmark bond yield is anticipated to ease to at least 6.50% in the coming months.
""Overall direction for bond yields is downwards for the next financial year,"" said VRC Reddy, treasury head at Karur Vysya Bank.
India's fiscal year runs April through March.
State-run Power Finance Corp will raise up to 80 billion rupees through the sale of 13-month, and three-year and four-month bonds this week.
The company, which typically prefers longer-duration debt, did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment. ($1 = 87.3000 Indian rupees)

RBI mandates banks to conduct special clearing operations on Monday,https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-mandates-banks-to-conduct-special-clearing-operations-on-monday-11743152041771.html,"Mumbai, Mar 28 (PTI) The RBI on Friday asked all banks to mandatorily participate in the special clearing operations on March 31 to facilitate accounting of all government transactions for 2024-25.
India follows the April 1-March 31 financial year.
The Income tax offices as well as CGST offices across the country will remain open on March 29 to March 31 despite the weekend and Eid-al-Fitr, which may fall on Monday.
Earlier, the RBI had said all government transactions done by agency banks for 2024-25 must be accounted for within the same financial year.
It had asked all agency banks to keep all branches dealing with government receipts and payments open for over-the-counter transactions related to government transactions up to the normal working hours on March 31, 2025.
In a circular on Friday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also said normal clearing timings under Cheque Truncation System (CTS) as applicable to any working ""Monday"" shall be followed on March 31, 2025.
""Further, to facilitate accounting of all the Government transactions for the current financial year (2024-25) by March 31, 2025, it has been decided to conduct special clearing under CTS exclusively for Government Cheques on March 31,"" it said.

"Indias financial system resilient, diverse: IMF report",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-financial-system-resilient-diverse-imf-report-11742829878363.html,"Mumbai, Mar 24 (PTI) The Indian financial system has become more resilient and diverse, driven by rapid economic growth and withstood the pandemic well, according to an IMF report.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), a joint programme of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB), undertakes a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of a country's financial sector.
IMF has released the latest India-FSSA report, based on the assessment carried out during 2024, while WB's Financial Sector Assessment (FSA) report is due for publication.
""India welcomes assessment of the Indian financial system undertaken by the joint IMF-World Bank team conforming to the highest international standards,"" the Reserve Bank said in a release on Monday.
The IMF report said that since the last FSAP in 2017, India’s financial system has become more resilient and diverse, driven by rapid economic growth.
""The system recovered from the distress episodes of the 2010s and withstood the pandemic well. NBFIs and market financing have grown, making the financial system more diverse and interconnected. State-owned financial institutions’ share remains significant,"" it said.
It further said that stress tests show that the main lending sectors are broadly resilient to macrofinancial shocks, despite some weak tails. Banks and NBFCs have sufficient aggregate capital to support moderate lending even in severe macro-financial scenarios.
""But several banks, particularly PSBs, may need to strengthen their capital base to support lending in such situations. Weak tails comprise a few non-systemic NBFCs and urban cooperative banks (UCBs) that report below minimum or negative capital even in the baseline. Vulnerability to short-term liquidity stress is generally contained,"" the report said.
On regulation and supervision of NBFCs, the IMF acknowledged India’s systematic approach to prudential requirements of NBFCs with the scale-based regulatory framework. IMF appreciated India's approach to the introduction of a bank-like Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) for large NBFCs.
IMF also acknowledged that the regulatory framework in securities markets has been enhanced in line with international practice to manage and prevent emerging risks. Notable improvements include establishing the Corporate Debt Market Development Fund (CDMDF).
The report observed that India’s insurance sector is strong and growing, with a significant presence in both life and general insurance. The sector has remained stable, supported by better regulations and digital innovations.
IMF also analysed cyber security frameworks in the banking sector, financial market infrastructure (FMI), critical information systems, and other relevant players in the securities market.
It found that Indian authorities have advanced cybersecurity risk oversight, especially for banks.
However, it stated that extensive cybersecurity crisis simulations and stress tests for banks could be expanded for cross-sectoral and market-wide events to further strengthen cybersecurity resilience.
The recommendations in the case of India FSAP are mainly focussed on bringing about further improvements in the structure and functioning of the financial system and many of the detailed recommendations are in conformity with the concerned authorities'/ regulators' own developmental plans.

India'sforeign exchange (forex) reservesincreased by nearly $15.3 billion to hit nearly $654 billion in the week to March 7, 2025. According to Bloomberg data, that is the highest weekly gain since August 27, 2021.
This comes after theRBI injected $10 billion through a foreign-exchange swapauction on February 28, stepping up efforts to ease a crunch in the financial system. The swap entails the central bank purchasing dollars from banks against the rupees they hold, while contracting to sell the greenback at a future date.

RBI injected $10 billion through a currency or foreign-exchange swap auction on February 28, stepping up efforts to ease one of the worst liquidity deficits to hit the country's financial system. According to Bloomberg, the infusion takes the amount poured into the banking system to $47 billion in February. It is part of RBI's plan to address the tightness in the money market.
The swap entails the central bank purchasing dollars from banks against the rupees they hold while contracting to sell the greenback at a future date. When the central bank buys dollars, it injects an equivalent quantum of rupee liquidity. After the swap's result was announced, the rupee extended losses, with the domestic currency down 0.3 per cent to 87.4900 per dollar.

The cash crunch has been caused partly by the central bank’s intervention in the foreign exchange market to shield the rupee from global volatility amid US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariff hikes. The shortfall in the market and liquidity crunch hurts an already slowing economy.
Liquidity in the financial system has tightened significantly since late 2024, with the deficit climbing to a 14-year high of₹3.3 lakh crore in January. RBI has taken several steps to replenish the system with funds, including auction-based open-market bond purchases worth₹1 trillion and an earlier foreign-exchange swap worth $5 billion.

Earlier this month, the central bank announced more measures to ease the tight liquidity conditions in the banking system. The measures, which include the purchase of government bonds underopen market operations (OMO)and foreign currency swaps, have been taken “on a review of current and evolving liquidity conditions”, the central bank said in a release on March 5.

“PSU Oil Marketing Companies have informed that there will be no increase in retail prices of #Petrol and #Diesel, subsequent to the increase effected in Excise Duty Rates today,” the oil ministry said in an X post on Monday.
Union Oil MinisterHardeep Singh Purialso confirmed the same during a press conference.

During his press briefing, Puri also revealed that fuel prices in general has been lower in India for the past three years, and credited the government for navigating through global oil crisis issues in a smooth manner.
His comments echoes a written reply to the Rajya Saba by MoS Suresh Gopi, who in a table format explained that India is the only major economy who reduced itspetrol priceand diesel price in the last three years.
“India has been the only major economy in the world where the prices of petrol and diesel have come down in recent years,” he said in the reply to a question asked by Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Singh Surjewala.
Here is a breakdown changes in petrol, diesel prices in India versus other countries between November 2021 and December 2024:

Government appoints DEA’s Ajay Seth as new Finance Secretary,https://www.livemint.com/economy/senior-bureaucrat-ajay-seth-designated-as-finance-secretary-following-appointment-of-tuhin-kant-pandey-sebi-chairman-11742821967898.html,"New Delhi: Economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth has been named India’s newfinance secretary, filling the vacancy created by Tuhin Kanta Pandey’s appointment as the chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
Seth, a 1987 batch Karnataka cadre Indian Administrative Services officer, played a key role in shaping India’s economic policies as secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs since 2021, overseeing critical initiatives related to infrastructure financing, public-private partnerships, and the management of external borrowings.
His appointment as finance secretary comes at a crucial time when the Union government is focused on maintainingfiscal disciplinewhile boosting economic growth.
India’s economic growth showed signs of recovery in the December quarter, climbing to 6.2% from 5.6% in the preceding three months, which was the slowest since the March quarter of FY23.
This leaves considerable ground to cover in the final quarter of this fiscal year to meet the revised full-year growth target of 6.5% as projected by the National Statistical Office on Friday.
Even if the target is met, India’sGDP growthfor FY25 would still be 270 basis points (bps) lower than the previous fiscal year’s revised growth estimate of 9.2%, underscoring the challenges that lie ahead for Seth in steering the economy.
Seth has an engineering degree from the Indian Institute of Technology in Roorkee and an MBA, and brings over three decades of expertise in public finance, taxation, and social sector administration.
He gained national recognition for transforming Karnataka’s commercial tax administration, earning the Prime Minister's Award for Excellence in Public Administration in 2013.
Speaking withMintafter the presentation of the Union budget in February, Seth had said the central government wouldraise the bar for benchmark reformsfor states seeking access to its 50-year interest-free capital expenditure loans, aiming to drive deregulation and improve ease of doing business—a key focus of the latest budget.
To be sure, the latest economic survey says India must accelerate domestic growth through deregulation and private investment as globalization slows.
The pre-budget report also emphasized that for India to achieve its goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047, it must sustain an 8% growth rate for at least a decade even as global uncertainties raise concerns about an economic slowdown.
“As we gain more experience, the quality of reforms continues to improve, and the expectations keep rising,” Seth had told Mint. “It’s no longer enough to simply announce a policy—that's not sufficient. We are now looking at real legislative changes and tangible impact on the ground.”

"‘Asia in the line of fire’! India, Thailand face higher US reciprocal tariffs risk, says Nomura",https://www.livemint.com/economy/asia-in-the-line-of-fire-india-thailand-face-higher-us-reciprocal-tariffs-risk-says-nomura-11741244501530.html,"India and Thailand may face increased reciprocal tariffs from the United States due to their higher relative tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, according to a recent analysis by Nomura. The report highlights that Washington's trade policy shift under PresidentDonald Trumpcould lead to broader tariff impositions across emerging and developed Asian economies.
Nomura's assessment suggests that the inclusion of non-tariff barriers—such as import policies, technical trade restrictions, and sanitary measures—raises the probability of reciprocal tariffs across multiple Asian nations. The report identifies India and Thailand as being particularly vulnerable due to their higher tariffs on US exports, especially in key sectors likeagricultureand transportation.
“Emerging Asian economies, particularly India and Thailand, have elevated tariff rates on US exports and could be at risk of higher reciprocal tariffs. By sector, Asia imposes steeper duties on agricultural products and transportation, the latter of which may be easier to adjust,” the Nomura report stated.
Sectors most at risk from the potential tariff hikes include animals, vegetables, food products, textiles and clothing, footwear, and transportation equipment. These industries could see significant trade disruptions if reciprocal tariffs are enacted.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump reiterated his commitment to imposing reciprocal tariffs on countries like India starting April 2, 2025. During his congressional address, he emphasised the necessity of tariffs to counter long-standing trade imbalances.
“If you don’t make your product in America under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff, and in some cases, a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn,” Trump stated.
Trump has already enforced a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with an additional 10 percent duty on Chinese goods. Nomura believes that whileChinaremains the primary focus of Trump’s America First Trade Policy (AFTP), the broader Asian market is also at risk.
“Asia is in the line of fire,”Nomura warned, pointing to the region’s substantial trade surplus with the US. Of the top 11 countries with which the US runs a trade deficit, seven are from Asia, including China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, India, and Thailand. Notably, Vietnam’s exports to the US constitute roughly 25 percent of its GDP.
Nomura's research highlights several Asian economies that could be hit by broad-based US tariff measures. Taiwan (6.3 percent of GDP), Thailand (5.6 percent), Malaysia (4.6 percent), Singapore (4.5 percent), and South Korea (4.5 percent) have notable exposure to US trade, with significant exports in electronics, pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles, and machinery.
Trump’s tariff proposals cover key industries, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, steel, aluminum, and forestry products. According to Nomura, about 20.6 percent of Asia’s exports to the US could be impacted, with Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Taiwan seeing more than a quarter of their exports affected.
Thesemiconductorsector remains particularly vulnerable. Trump has indicated potential tariffs on chips, though whether this serves as a negotiation tactic to encourage Asian firms to invest in US manufacturing remains uncertain. Given Asia’s dominance in semiconductor production, such tariffs could disrupt the supply chain. However, imposing these duties may prove complex due to the geographically dispersed production processes.
“Our deep dive suggests that while the direct impact of higher chip tariffs on Asia may be modest, indirect effects are a greater concern,” Nomura noted. “A slowdown in US consumer demand could impact economies deeply embedded in the electronics supply chain, with Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam being the most exposed.”
Nomura also warned that US efforts to clamp down on tariff circumvention could impact third countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand, which incorporate a high proportion of Chinese value-added components in their exports to the US. This could make certain products from these countries susceptible to heightened scrutiny and additional trade restrictions.
In anticipation of further trade disruptions under Trump’s potential second term, Asian policymakers are formulating strategies to mitigate risks. These include increasing investments in the US, lowering tariffs on American imports, expanding trade alliances outside the US, and adapting to shifting supply chains.
“Many Asian nations are stepping up efforts to strengthen their economic relationships beyond the US while simultaneously positioning themselves to capitalize on future supply chain shifts,” Nomura concluded.
With global trade tensions poised to escalate, India, Thailand, and other Asian economies may need to navigate a challenging landscape in the coming years, balancing trade diplomacy with economic resilience.

"India’s retail inflation hits seven-month low of 3.61%, food inflation lowest since May 2023, industrial output quickens",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-retail-inflation-hits-seven-month-low-of-3-61-in-february-2025-food-inflation-lowest-since-may-2023-11741768852856.html,"New Delhi: India's retail inflation eased to a seven-month low in February, driven by a slower increase in food prices, according to provisional government data released on Wednesday, fuelling hopes of an interest rate cut.
Retail inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), was at 3.61% in February, down from 4.26% in January.
Retail inflation was 5.22% in December, 5.48% in November and 5.09% in the year-ago period, the ministry of statistics & programme implementation (MoSPI) data showed.
Interestingly, food inflation eased to 3.75% in February, after reporting a 5.97% increase in January, a figure revised in the latest MoSPI update from the 6.02% rise announced last month.
Meanwhile, industrial output growth picked up in January, after slowing down in the previous month, due to a rise in manufacturing and mining activities.
The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) rew at 5% in January, up from 3.2% in the previous month, according to the latest estimates released by MoSPI.
India's industrial output surged past expectations in January, driven by robust growth in manufacturing and mining.

AMintpoll of 25 economists projected retail inflation at a five-month low of 3.9% in February, driven by falling food prices.
This marks the fourth straight month of easing inflation, strengthening the case for another RBI rate cut in April.
After reporting a 6.4% growth during the December quarter, the slowest since Q4FY23, barring one quarter, economists widely expect the central bank to opt for a rate cut next month.
""The inflation trajectory is turning more benign than earlier expectations thereby creating further room for sharper monetary easing. We expect a 25 bps rate cut each in April and June policy along with a shift in the stance to accommodative,"" said Upasna Bhardwaj, Chief Economist, Kotak Mahindra Bank.
""Beyond June, we continue to monitor the downside risks to growth to decipher room for additional rate easing,"" she added.
The RBI aims to keep CPI inflation at 4%, within a ±2% range.
Food prices have remained elevated for some time, staying above 7% from November 2023 to June 2024, primarily due to the previous year's uneven and below-normal monsoon rains.
While overall food inflation has been slowing, the prices of key food items like fruit have remained high.

In February, the prices of cereals, meat, eggs, vegetables, milk and pulses rose at a slower pace than the previous month, while prices of fruit, oil and fats saw an increase.
Overall, the inflation for food and beverages rose by 3.84% in February, down from 5.68% in January and 7.69% in December.
The price of clothing and footwear rose by 2.68% yearly, both in January and February.
Economists note that while agricultural production is projected to reach a record high in 2024-25, according to the second advance estimate, favourable agricultural prospects, fresh Rabi harvest arrivals, and healthy reservoir levels are positive signs for food inflation.
""Food inflation is likely to remain benign in the coming months, however, we need to be cautious of any weather-related disruptions,"" said Rajani Sinha, chief economist, CareEdge.
""Going ahead, we project the CPI inflation to stay around the 4% levels supported by comfortable core inflation and moderating food inflation. The trajectory of global commodity prices remains monitorable given the overhang of uncertain trade policies and geopolitical tensions,"" Sinha added.
Interestingly, 12 of the 22 states reported inflation below the 3.6%-mark inFebruary – Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.
Last month, the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reset its repo rate to 6.25%, the first such easing move since the 2020 covid outbreak.
After the decision, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said that the MPC found a less restrictive monetary policy more suitable for the current economic conditions while maintaining a neutral stance.
Thus, the RBI's focus may shift from curbing inflation—forecast at 4.8% for 2024-25 and 4.2% in 2025-26—to boosting credit and supporting an economy set to slow to 6.4% in 2024-25, with only a modest recovery expected next year.

""Easing food prices, coupled with lower global crude oil prices, have provided a supportive backdrop for inflation to align more closely with the RBI’s 4% target,"" said Sujan Hajra, chief economist and executive director, Anand Rathi Group.
""Against this backdrop, the RBI, which recently cut the repo rate by 25 basis points and implemented liquidity measures to address the system’s deficit, is likely to maintain its easing cycle,"" Hajra added.
India’s industrial output surged past expectations in January, driven by strong manufacturing and mining activity, provisional data released by MoSPI on Wednesday showed.
Industrial production rose 5% year-on-year, exceeding economists' forecast of 3.5% in a Reuters poll and up from 3.5% in December, revised from 3.2% in the latest release.
The last time industrial output grew at this pace was in November.
Manufacturing expanded 5.5% in January, while mining rose 4.4% and electricity generation increased 2.4%.
In December, these sectors had grown by 3.4%, 2.7%, and 6.2%, respectively.
""The major push has come from non-metallic minerals, base metals, electric equipment, electronics to an extent and other transport equipment. Eight of the 23 major segments showed higher than 5% growth,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at the Bank of Baroda.
""In terms of use-based industries, capital goods showed an increase of 7.8% indicating a revival of private investment,"" Sabnavis added.
During the April-January (2024-25) period, industrial output increased by 4.2%, compared to 6% a year ago.
Consumer durables output, including vehicles and household appliances, grew 7.2% in January, down from 8.3% in December.
Capital goods output, which includes manufacturing plants and machinery, rose 7.8% in January, easing from the revised 10.4% the previous month.
Meanwhile, output of primary goods rose 5.5% in January, compared to 3.8% in December.
Production of capital goods rose 7.8% in January, down from 10.4% in the previous month.

The production of infrastructure and construction goods rose by 7% against December's revised 7.4% growth.
""The IIP growth improved to a higher-than-expected 5.0% in January 2025, led by manufacturing and mining. The use-based data is less enthusing, with a sequential YoY pickup seen in only two segments (consumer non-durables and primary goods) amidst a slowdown in the other four,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist, ICRA.
""ICRA expects the IIP expansion to moderate to about 3-4% in February 2025 from 5% in January 2025,"" she added.

"RBI to focus on better customer service and protection, says governor Malhotra",https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-governor-sanjay-malhotra-bank-customer-service-rbi-agenda-financial-sector-regulation-11743500545154.html,"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will push for wider financial inclusion and enhancing customer service and protection, governor Sanjay Malhotra said on Tuesday.

Tariffs should be tapered off after building globally competitive domestic businesses: Niti Aayog member,https://www.livemint.com/economy/tariffs-bilateral-trade-deal-finance-ministry-domestic-businesses-supply-chain-arvind-virmani-niti-aayog-11741515582488.html,"New Delhi:Tariffs aimed at protecting domestic industries from foreign competition have to be gradually tapered off as these industries learn to stand on their feet, Niti Aayog member Arvind Virmani said.
According to the former chief economic advisor in the finance ministry, tariffs are effective only if they help in building globally competitive domestic businesses. His comments follow recent threats of reciprocal tariffs against India and other countries by US president Donald Trump.
In India, the thinking behind tariffs during the 1991 economic reforms was to help the domestic industry become competitive and to then reduce these duties gradually over time.
“It is a good approach and if we can get something in return through a bilateral trade deal, that is something even better,” said Virmani, who was in the finance ministry during the period of 1991 reforms.
“For (tariff) protection to be effective, it must create companies which are competitive in the export market, which means tariffs must gradually come down. It is called infant industry protection and at some point, one has to stand on one’s own feet,” said Virmani in an interview.
Also read |Trump tariffs: Is the US president doomed to repeat history?
But its timing has to be thought of carefully and negotiated, he said. “It cannot be out of the blue, just because we have not lowered it for a long time.""
On what advantage India could expect from a trade deal with the US, Virmani a recommended a framework facilitating free movement across the two countries for goods that go into products like electronic goods that have a complex supply chain—that is, requiring value addition in different places.
These products require components and sub-assemblies to move from place to place for value addition before the final product is arrived at.
“It is a network. What we want in a network is to have a partner with a lot of electronics demand—whether it is the US or the EU – so that movement of goods is facilitated so that everything which is labour-intensive can come to India and go back there,” Virmani said.
“So US companies should find it easy to bring parts in, assemble it, take it back and put it into something else and a low tariff structure to facilitate that. We want to have this back and forth so that they can set up plants here for certain parts of the supply chain. That is the objective of facilitating supply chains through tariffs,” said Virmani.

However, the design of such supply chains has to be carefully structured so that near-zero import tariff benefits only those products that have high-cumulative mutual value addition. That is, the two countries could have near-zero customs duty on certain products from each other. Suc low tariffs would apply to goods that are nearly fully locally made in the two partnering countries, with minimal input from any other country.
This would strengthen the supply chain between the two nations. On items produced in either of the country with a high level of inputs from third countries, bilateral tariff concessions between India and US are not needed as the benefit would go to those third countries from where inputs originate, Virmani said. On such products, import tariffs could be increased by both the countries on mutual understanding.
The timing of the tariff phase-out is also critical: “It cannot be out of the blue, just because we have not lowered it for a long time.”

Virmani's remarks come as government officials increasingly signal to the domestic industry to prepare for protection phase-outs. Higher basic customs duty rates wherever introduced to protect the domestic industry from global competition, cannot continue perpetually, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) chairperson Sanjay Agarwal said in an interview withMintpublished on 24 July last year.
India is currently talking to high-income developed countries such as the US, UK and EU for bilateral trade deals, which are expected to involve mutual concessions for greater market access.

"Indian banks loan growth slows for eighth straight month in February, RBI data shows",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indian-banks-loan-growth-slows-for-eighth-straight-month-in-february-rbi-data-shows-11743075103474.html,"MUMBAI, March 27 (Reuters) - Loan growth at Indian banks moderated for an eighth straight month in February, central bank data showed on Thursday, due to a drop in personal and credit card loans following tighter rules by the Reserve Bank of India.
The data showed that banks' credit increased by 12% year-on-year last month, slower than the 16.6% rise a year earlier, excluding the impact of HDFC Bank's merger with parent Housing Development Finance Corp.
Including the merger impact, loans grew 11% in February, compared with 20.5% in the year-ago period.
The loan growth rate slowed to 12.5% in January, excluding the merger, and to 11.4% including the merger.
India's banking sector saw rapid loan growth for several years, driven by retail demand for unsecured loans.
However, the RBI intervened in late 2023, imposing stricter capital requirements on personal loans, credit card loans as well as credit to non-banking finance companies (NBFCs).
Concerned about potential bad loans, the RBI's tighter lending norms aimed to mitigate risk. Banks simultaneously reduced lending to optimise their credit-deposit ratio - a key liquidity metric - amid a scramble to raise deposits.
As a result, loan growth has slowed significantly over the past few months, with personal and credit card loans particularly affected.
However, the RBI relaxed its capital requirement rule last month, marking a significant shift since Sanjay Malhotra took over as governor in December.
Although analysts expect the change to positively impact the economy, they say that the effect will only become apparent in a few months.
Banks' personal loan growth more than halved to 8.4% year-on-year in February from 19.5% a year ago, excluding the HDFC Bank merger impact, while growth in outstanding credit card debt dropped to 11.2% from 31%, the data showed.
Credit growth in the services sector decelerated to 13% in February from 21.4%, primarily due to a drop in loans to NBFCs.
Meanwhile, loans to industries grew 7.3% last month, lower than the 8.4% a year earlier. (Reporting by Siddhi Nayak; Editing by Sonia Cheema)

"Donald Trump rejects EU’s ‘very, very bad’ zero-for-zero tariff proposal: ’They don’t take our cars, like Japan’",https://www.livemint.com/economy/donald-trump-rejects-eus-very-very-bad-zero-for-zero-tariff-proposal-they-dont-take-our-cars-like-japan-11744112272999.html,"US President Donald Trump has rejected the European Union's proposal for an exemption from tariffs on industrial products, including cars, stating that it is not enough to address the transatlantic trade deficit. ""The European Union has been very, very bad to us, they don't take our cars, like Japan in that sense, they don't take our agricultural product. They don't take anything practically,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.
On Monday,European Commission President Ursula von der Leyenproposed a ""zero-for-zero"" tariff arrangement for industrial products, including cars, in a bid to defuse escalating trade tensions with the United States.
Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, von der Leyen stated, “We have proposed zero tariffs on industrial products... Europe is always ready to strike a good deal with the United States.”
However, she warned that the European Union (EU) would not hesitate to implement countermeasures if negotiations failed, vowing to ""defend our interests"" against President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies.
Meanwhile, reports suggest that the EU is considering retaliatory tariffs of up to 25% on select American products, including food items and luxury goods.
Last week,President Trump announced a 20% tariff on European goods, further intensifying his protectionist trade stance.
The new tariffs, set to take effect on April 9, target key European exports such as automobiles and machinery.
Donald Trump justified the imposition of tariffs by accusing the EU of unfair trade practices, claiming that European nations restrict imports of American cars and agricultural products.
The transatlantic trade relationship is one of the most significant globally, with annual trade in goods and services exceeding €1 trillion. However, the United States recorded a goods trade deficit of $235.6 billion with the EU in 2024, according to data from the US Trade Representative’s office.
Donald Trump has argued that trade deficit could be addressed if European countries committed to purchasing American energy products. The US president suggested that such an agreement would need to be worth $350 billion—far exceeding the actual deficit—to resolve the issue.
European exports to the US are dominated by sectors such as machinery, vehicles, and chemicals, which accounted for nearly 68% of total exports last year. Analysts warn that these industries could face severe disruptions if tariffs escalate further.
The announcement of newUS tariffs by Donald Trumpsent shockwaves through European financial markets on Monday. Germany's DAX index recorded losses of 5 per cent while France's CAC 40 dropped by 1.8%. The FTSE 100 index plummeted by as much as 5% at the opening, eventually closing down by 3.8%, reaching its lowest level in nearly 14 months.
Economists have warned that continued escalation could push Europe’s already fragile economy closer to recession.
On April 7, global stock markets experienced a sharp downturn, with analysts dubbing the day ""Black Monday"" due to fears of disrupted trade flows and rising inflation triggered by President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff policies.
In US, the S&P 500 fell by 1.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by over 600 points during intraday trading.
In India, stock markets witnessed their worst trading day in ten months. TheBSE Sensex plummeted by over 2,200 points to close at 73,137.90, while the NSE Nifty 50 tumbled by nearly 750 pointsto 22,161.60.
The India VIX, a measure of market volatility, surged by nearly 65% as investors dumped riskier assets amid growing fears of a global recession. Foreign institutional investors offloaded Indian stocks worth $1.05 billion, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent times.

India’s forex reserves jump by $305 million to hit over three-month high of $654.27 billion after RBI’s currency swap,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-forex-reserves-jump-by-305-million-to-hit-over-three-month-high-of-654-271-billion-after-rbis-currency-swap-11742572528732.html,"India'sforeign exchange (forex) reservesincreased by $305 million to to a more than three-month high of $654.271 billion during the week ended March 14. In the previous reporting week, the overall reserves rose by $15.267 billion to $653.966 billion and registered the sharpest weekly rise in two years and the biggest jump since August 2021.
The spike in foreign reserves was partly attributed to the $10 billion forex swap done by theReserve Bank of India (RBI). India's forex reserves have been on a declining trend recently due to the current revaluation, along withforex marketinterventions by the RBI to help reduce volatilities in the rupee. Forex reserves increased to an all-time high of $704.885 billion in September

For the week ended March 14, 2025, the foreign currency assets (FCA), seen as a major component of the reserves, decreased by $96 million to $557.186 billion. Expressed in dollar terms, the FCA include the central bank's intervention in the forex market and the effect of appreciation or depreciation of non-US units like the euro, pound and yen held in the forex reserves.

India's reserve position with the IMF was also up by $283 million at $4.431 billion in the reporting week.
The rupee and most Asian currencies have been volatile due to an uncertain global risk environment, gripped by uncertainties surrounding global trade and growth from constant changes in US tariff plans. The RBI has curtailed volatility in the forex market through dollar sales in the spot market and has conducted dollar-rupee buy-sell swaps to help boost rupee liquidity in the banking system.
According to RBI, gold reserves increased by $66 million to $74.391 billion during the week. In the week to which the reserves data pertains, the rupee depreciated 0.1 per cent week-on-week.The currency ended at 85.9725 on Friday. It rose to a 10-week high of 85.9375 during the session and gained 1.2 per cent in the week.

UK and EU Advance Talks on Seizing Frozen Russian Assets,https://www.livemint.com/economy/uk-and-eu-advance-talks-on-seizing-frozen-russian-assets-11742252135434.html,"The UK and European Union will advance talks on how to seize frozen Russian assets to jointly boost defense spending, as they seek ways to increase economic pressure on Vladimir Putin ahead of any peace talks to end his war on Ukraine.
Foreign Secretary David Lammy and the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, will review “innovative initiatives” to collectively step up European defense funding and bolster military readiness in a meeting in London on Tuesday, the UK Foreign Office said.
The talks will include how Europe ensures it has the right legal and financial cover to seize billions in Russian assets, according to people familiar with the matter. Progress is being made despite resistance from some European countries like Belgium and Germany who remain concerned that confiscation could breach the principle of a state’s immunity under international law and impact the euro, they said.
“It is not the United States that has raised consistent concerns about sovereign assets...it’s actually within Europe,” Lammy told the House of Commons on Monday. The change of administration in Germany may allow the country to shift its position on the issue, he said.
Europe’s effort to dial up pressure on Russia comes ahead of another call between US President Donald Trump and Putin on Tuesday. The US is pressing for Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine has said it’s ready to accept.
The EU, Group of Seven countries and Australia have frozen about $280 billion of Russian central bank assets in the form of securities and cash, mostly through the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear. Sanctions imposed on prominent Russian individuals froze an additional estimated $58 billion in assets, including homes, yachts and private aircraft.
Lammy and Kallas will also discuss the EU’s proposal to allow member states to invest €150 billion of EU loans on defense hardware, which can be spent on weapons from some third countries like the UK, Norway and Switzerland, the people said. The UK wouldn’t have to pay into the fund, but would benefit from EU states placing orders with British defense firms.
“It’s vital we upgrade our partnership with the EU and work together to bring an end to this war and deliver security of all of our citizens,” Lammy said in a statement.

RBIs revised priority sector lending norms ease credit constraints in renewable energy sector: SBI,https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbis-revised-priority-sector-lending-norms-ease-credit-constraints-in-renewable-energy-sector-sbi-11742957224927.html,"New Delhi [India], March 26 (ANI): The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) revised guidelines for Priority Sector Lending (PSL) have helped ease credit constraints in the renewable energy sector, according to a report by the State Bank of India (SBI).
The report highlighted that RBI's explicit recognition and prioritization of renewable energy under PSL norms have led to a higher share of non-conventional energy (NCE) credit within the overall energy credit.
The report, based on a dummy variable linear regression model for FY10-24, indicates that policy interventions in the sector have encouraged increased credit flow to non-conventional energy projects. Over the years, the central bank has expanded the scope of PSL norms to facilitate lending to clean energy initiatives.
It said ""Explicit recognition and prioritization of renewable energy within the PSL framework has alleviated credit constraints thereby escalation in the share of non-conventional energy credit to the overall energy credit""
On July 1, 2015, RBI included loans up to₹15 crore for projects such as solar-based power generators, biomass-based power generators, micro-hydel plants, and other non-conventional energy-based public utilities like street lighting systems and village electrification.
Later, on September 4, 2020, this loan limit was doubled to₹30 crore per borrower, reflecting strong support for the sector. In the latest revision, RBI has further raised the cap to₹35 crore per borrower, marking a 17 per cent increase. However, for individual households, the maximum loan amount remains unchanged at₹10 lakh.
Although the₹5 crore increase in the lending limit may seem small compared to the 2020 revision, the report believes such incremental policy measures will significantly contribute to the growth of the renewable energy sector. By supporting clean energy financing under PSL, these measures align with India's broader environmental goals.
The report said ""the small policy interventions definitely will go long way, for the NCE sector, to achieve dual objective of clean energy"".
India has set ambitious targets for clean energy expansion, aiming for 500 GW of non-fossil fuel installed capacity by 2030 and achieving Net Zero emissions by 2070.
The RBI's support through PSL norms is expected to play a crucial role in achieving these objectives by making credit more accessible for green energy projects. (ANI)

India’s trade deficit likely narrowed to USD 21.5 Bln in February from USD 23 Bln in January: UBI Report,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-trade-deficit-likely-narrowed-to-usd-21-5-bln-in-february-from-usd-23-bln-in-january-ubi-report-11741748022464.html,"New Delhi [India], March 12 (ANI): India's trade deficit likely narrowed to USD 21.5 billion in February, down from USD 23 billion in January, according to a report by Union Bank of India.
However, the report also noted that the geopolitical risks, especially concerns over tariffs, will continue to influence trade dynamics.
It said ""Merchandise trade deficit likely narrowed in Feb'25 to USD 21.5 bln vis-a-vis USD 23.0 bln a month ago"".
The report suggested that the reduction in the merchandise trade deficit was mainly driven by a moderation in the Non-Oil-Non-Gold (NONG) segment, supported by seasonal factors during the quarter.
Despite this improvement, the report added that the extent of recovery in trade balance may be limited due to growing concerns over new trade restrictions and tariff increases following the change in the U.S. administration.
The oil trade deficit is also expected to have narrowed in February, supported by a fall in global Brent crude oil prices. Brent crude dropped to USD 74.95 per barrel in February from USD 78.35 per barrel in January.
A notable trend was the decline in oil imports from Russia, which fell 14.5 per cent month-on-month to 1.43 million bpd, the lowest level since January 2023. As a result, Russia's share in India's total oil imports dropped to around 30 per cent in February, a sharp decline from the 2024 average of approximately 38 per cent.
Although crude oil prices eased in February, the report noted that the impact on imports might be delayed since contracts are signed in advance. This could explain why India's oil import bill declined in January compared to December, even though prices and volumes had increased sequentially.
Gold imports are estimated to have risen to 70 tonnes in February, up from 40 tonnes in January. This increase was likely driven by seasonal demand during the marriage season.
Additionally, investment demand for physical gold remained strong due to pressure on riskier assets like equities. The report highlights that with ongoing global economic uncertainties under Trump's second term, the demand for gold as a safe-haven asset is expected to persist.
Looking ahead, the report noted that the geopolitical risks, particularly concerns over trade tariffs, will continue to shape India's trade performance in the coming months. (ANI)

"Rising global uncertainties threaten exports, and economic growth: Finance Ministry",https://www.livemint.com/economy/rising-global-uncertainties-exports-economic-growth-finance-ministry-nirmala-sitharaman-wto-trump-us-nso-gdp-11742994798800.html,"Global tensions, trade policy uncertainties, volatile commodity prices and financial market fluctuations pose significant risks to global and domestic growth, the Union finance ministry said, at a time when India is working to limit the impact of US tariff actions.
In FY25, India’s exports slowed due to tariff-related developments across multiple countries, increasing trade risks and disrupting global investment and trade flows, the ministry said in the economic review for February released on Wednesday.
""The Global Trade Policy Uncertainty Index rose to a record high of 237.4 in Q4 2024. Tariff-related developments in multiple countries have heightened trade-related risks, affecting investment and trade flows globally. Consequently, India’s exports have recorded softer growth thus far in FY25. However, a robust services trade surplus continues to offset the impact of lower growth in merchandise exports,"" the review said.
India’s goods exports rose a tepid 1.39% year-on-year to $358.91 billion in April 2024–January 2025, while imports grew 7.43% to $601.90 billion, leaving a trade deficit of $22.99 billion as of January 2025, according to commerce ministry data.
In addition to slowing global trade and an economic slowdown in advanced economies, US President Donald Trump's reciprocal global tariffs could further disrupt several markets, including India.

In October, the WTO revised its 2024 global goods trade growth forecast slightly upward to 2.7% from 2.6%, but lowered the 2025 estimate to 3% from 3.3%, citing weaker-than-expected demand in Europe but stronger performance in Asia. However, this was before the US announced the global reciprocal tariffs.
Recently,Reutersreported that the Centre estimates such reciprocal tariffs could hit 87% of India's total exports to the United States worth $66 billion. However, both nations are currently negotiating a trade deal, which could soften the impact of such tariffs.
""The budget has also posited agriculture, MSMEs, Investment and Exports as engines of growth, outlining initiatives under each of them, thereby generating optimism about continued resilience in the economy amidst geo-political constraints,"" the February review added.

The report also said stable commodity prices and robust private sector capital formation, driven by India’s strong fundamentals, will boost growth in FY26.
""Supportive fiscal measures, accommodative monetary policy, and the Union Budget’s focus on longer-term development drivers and reform will bolster domestic economic resilience amidst significant global uncertainties,"" it added.
India's growth has slowed down considerably from last fiscal, though it remains the fastest-growing major economy. Real GDP grew by 8.2% in FY24 (2023-24) and is estimated to grow by 6.5% in FY25 (2024-25), according to the National Statistical Office (NSO).
To be sure, India’s economic growth picked up in the December quarter (Q3, FY25), with GDP expanding 6.2%, recovering from a low of 5.6% in the previous quarter, reporting the slowest quarterly growth since Q4FY23, barring Q2. Achieving the revised full-year growth target of 6.5%, as projected by the NSO, will need stronger momentum, requiring 7.6% in the final quarter of the year to align with the second advance estimate.
As things stand, the third quarter’s growth was supported by government spending and consumption amid festive demand.
Key levers of the economy — exports, consumption, investments -- along with sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, construction, and services—need to fire on all cylinders to drive growth and sustaining momentum in the final quarter.
Also read |State borrowings to surge about 18% in Q4 after slowing Q2 GDP growth
To be sure, the total investments made in the economy, represented by the gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), slowed to 5.7% in Q3, FY25 down from 5.8% in Q2 and 9.3% in the year-ago period.
However, private final consumption expenditure (PFCE), a proxy for private consumption, grew 6.9% in the December quarter, up from 5.9% in Q2 and 5.7% a year ago, while government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) surged 8.3%, rebounding from 3.8% in Q1 and -0.5% in Q2, reflecting higher government spending. Key levers like agriculture, manufacturing, and exports reported growth during Q3, FY25, compared to the previous quarter.
According to the latest HSBC flash survey, India’s private sector showed signs of softening in March due to slower growth in the services sector; manufacturing, however, remained resilient, reporting strong growth. The HSBC PMI Output Index (manufacturing) rose to 60.6 in March—its highest level since July 2024.
Economist Poonam Gupta, director general of the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), noted in a recent report that despite global headwinds, several high-frequency indicators signal a nascent turnaround in the Indian economy, reflected in improvements in the manufacturing PMI, GST collections, and both EV and non-EV sales.
""Moderation in inflation has opened up more policy space. The agriculture sector is also exhibiting much-needed resilience, which bodes well for both inflation control and rural push to the economy,"" she said.
India’s retail inflation fell to a seven-month low of 3.61% in February, down from 4.26% in January, driven by slower food price growth, raising hopes of an interest rate cut. Food inflation eased to 3.75% in February, down from 5.97% in January.

“Exports will face pressure from US actions and weakened global demand, but the impact will be felt more in FY26. Meanwhile, consumption and investment are expected to strengthen, aided by RBI’s support on interest rates, the central government’s efforts to meet the fiscal deficit target, and the income tax exemption,” said Bhanumurthy N.R., director, Madras School of Economics.
He added, “Economic activity is expected to pick up in the last two quarters, helping achieve the 6.5% GDP growth target, with room for an upward revision. Most challenges, however, will stem from external factors.""

China Banks Cut Consumer Loan Rates to Record Low to Spur Demand,https://www.livemint.com/economy/china-banks-cut-consumer-loan-rates-to-record-low-to-spur-demand-11742336628209.html,"Chinese banks are slashing rates on consumer loans to record lows as policymakers ramp up stimulus to stabilize growth and counter US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
Lenders across the wealthier areas of Shanghai, the nation’s financial capital, and Hangzhou, a key tech hub, are engaged in a price war, offering annual interest rates as low as 2.58% on loans to fuel restaurant visits and shopping, according to online ads. That compares to rates as high as 10% about two years ago.
Beijing is seeking to ignite consumer spending and stoke local demand to help make the long-struggling economy less reliant on trade and exports. The National Financial Regulatory Administration last week urged banks to expand the issuance of personal consumer loans while ensuring reasonable terms including credit limits and interest rates.
“The record low rates are a reflection of fierce competition among banks amid low loan demand,” said May Yan, head of Asia financials research at UBS Group AG. “But the root lies in people’s weak expectation for income growth and economic outlook. Cheap loans might help lift consumption to an extent, but banks need to be vigilant on risk control to avoid an increase in bad loans.”
Among those offering the cheapest rates were the Bank of Jiangsu Co., which is promoting a preferential annualized interest of 2.58% on consumer loans of up to 1 million yuan before the end of March. Bank of Ningbo Co. is touting an annualized rate of 2.68% for first-time borrowers with a maximum quota of 200,000 yuan, promising speedy approvals within 1 minute.
Boosting consumption has been a challenge for Beijing since the end of the pandemic. Retail sales have been anemic, while consumer prices fell into deflation in February for the first time in over a year. The central bank is now studying plans to create new structural monetary policy tools to provide low-cost financial support for key consumption sectors, an official said Monday.
The lending efforts put the banks, which Beijing has traditionally relied upon to guide funding to desired areas, in a tight spot as they fight record low margins to dole out cheap loans when borrowing demand remains sluggish.
That means lenders will have to snatch existing consumer loan borrowers from their peers amid an unhealthy competition, bank officials familiar with the matter said, adding the effectiveness in boosting consumption remains to be seen.
The moves could bring in more borrowers with poor credit, raising concerns that the returns may not be sufficient to cover the default risks, said the bankers, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter.
China has set an ambitious economic growth goal of about 5% for 2025 and brought its fiscal deficit target to the highest in more than three decades. Lifting consumer spending is key to countering US policies. At the same time, China is still grappling with a prolonged property slump that has suppressed demand and kept prices low throughout the economy while wages stagnate.
There are signs some of the efforts are paying off. China’s retail sales increased 4% in January-February from the same period a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday, accelerating from a 3.7% gain in December.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development this week forecast global growth will slow this year, cutting its outlook for most members. Still, it said China should prove more resilient as domestic policy support offsets the impact of tariffs.

"Budget aims to do reforms to build Viksit Bharat by 2047, says FM Niramala Sitharaman",https://www.livemint.com/economy/budget-aims-to-do-reforms-to-build-viksit-bharat-by-2047-says-fm-niramala-sitharaman-11742919436096.html,"New Delhi [India], March 25 (ANI): Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Tuesday, underscored the Union government's commitment to providing tax certainty and streamlining business regulations as part of the broader vision to build a Viksit Bharat by 2047.
""The Budget aims to do reforms to build Viksit Bharat by 2047. It aims to provide tax certainty, reforms on ease of doing business also we will have a new Income Tax Bill which is currently with a special Committee. This Bill is not brought as part of Finance Bill,"" Sitharaman stated speaking at the discussion on Finance Bill 2025.The lower house on Tuesday passed the Finance Bill, 2025 with 35 government amendments.
Elaborating on tax reforms, she announced a reduction in customs tariff rates on industrial goods, cutting the number of tariff slabs from 21 to just eight. Additionally, she clarified that either cess or surcharge--not both--can be levied on an item under direct tax provisions.
""We have removed seven custom tariff rates on industrial goods, reducing tariff from 21 to 8 per cent. We have ensured that no one item is cess and a surcharge can be applied. Only one can be levied,"" says FM Sitharaman while speaking on direct taxes.
""Time given to exporters who import some components to produce goods to export has been increased from six months to one year,"" she added.
Addressing concerns over indirect taxation, the Finance Minister assured that prasadams from temples, mosques, churches, and gurudwaras would remain exempt from GST.
She also mentioned that a Group of Ministers (GoM) is evaluating GST reductions on ingredients used in preparing these prasadams. Furthermore, she announced that imported drugs for rare diseases--whether by individual patients or research organisations--have been exempted from Integrated GST (IGST).
In a move to support exporters, Sitharaman declared that businesses importing components for export production will now have one year instead of six months to use those inputs, providing them greater flexibility.
On the issue of GST compensation, Sitharaman categorically stated that no pending dues remain for states.
""When states submitted auditor-certified claims, all payments were made. The law clearly states that GST compensation cess ended on June 30, 2022,"" she affirmed.
Clarifying the ongoing collection of cess, she explained that the government is currently repaying loans taken during the COVID-19 pandemic and that this repayment process will conclude by early 2026. (ANI)

Front-loading ahead of tariffs boosts US durable goods orders,https://www.livemint.com/economy/frontloading-ahead-of-tariffs-boosts-us-durable-goods-orders-11743003040934.html,"*
Durable goods orders increase 0.9% in February
*
Orders for core capital goods orders fall 0.3%
*
Shipments of core capital goods rebound 0.9%
By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON, - Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods unexpectedly rose in February as businesses rushed to avoid potential price increases from tariffs, likely boosting capital expenditure in the first quarter.
But the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday did not change economists' expectations that economic growth was slowing considerably in the first quarter as
businesses
and
households
grapple with a fluid import duty environment. President Donald Trump has announced a blizzard of tariff actions since taking office in January. Economists have warned that the manner in which the tariffs are being handled was not supportive of economic activity.
""There is tremendous uncertainty coming from Washington, but companies are not just holding their breath waiting for the other tariff shoe to drop, they are actively ordering up more equipment to beat the price increases once the trade war sanctions jack up the cost of the goods and materials they need to even higher levels,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, increased 0.9% after advancing by an upwardly revised 3.3% in January, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast durable goods orders would fall 1.0%.
Primary metals orders rose 1.2%, while those for fabricated metal products rebounded 0.9%. Electrical equipment, appliances and components orders jumped 2.0%. Economists attributed the rise in orders for these goods to front-loading ahead of tariffs, adding that trade policy uncertainty and higher borrowing costs remained constraints for manufacturing, which accounts for 10.3% of the economy.
Trump has imposed a new 20% duty on all imports from China and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico that are not compliant with a North American trade agreement.
The U.S. president has fully restored 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico, EU and other countries, and next week is set to announce higher U.S. ""reciprocal tariffs"" to match the duty rates of trading partners and offset non-tariff barriers. Trump also has said that he will soon impose sectoral tariffs on imported autos, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.
""The demand data show conditions are not fueling a broad and sustained recovery in capex spending,"" said Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo. ""Small business intentions around capital spending remain historically low as many businesses, like the Fed, are sitting and waiting for clarity.""
BUSINESS SENTIMENT DETERIORATING The Federal Reserve last week left interest rates unchanged, an acknowledgement of the uncertainty swirling around the economy. Optimism among company chief financial officers dropped in the first quarter of 2025, a survey from two regional Fed banks and Duke University showed on Wednesday.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar advanced against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
Orders for machinery climbed 0.2% last month while those for transportation equipment increased 1.5%. They were lifted by a 4.0% rebound in demand for motor vehicles and parts and a 9.3% rise in defense aircraft and parts orders, more than offsetting a 5.0% decline in commercial aircraft orders.
Boeing reported on its website that it had received only 13 aircraft orders in February compared to 36 in January.
Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.3% after an upwardly revised 0.9% surge in January. Economists had forecast these so-called core capital goods orders would gain 0.2% after a previously reported 0.8% jump in January. Shipments of core capital goods rebounded 0.9%, the most in a year, after falling 0.2% in January.
Non-defense capital goods orders declined 1.5% after accelerating 12.8% in January. Shipments of these goods rose 0.5% after vaulting 3.2% in the prior month.
Core and non-defense capital goods shipments go into the calculation of the business spending on equipment component in the gross domestic product report. The rise in shipments suggested a rebound in business spending on equipment this quarter after a contraction in the fourth quarter.
But the decline in orders pointed to weakness in equipment investment beyond the first quarter. Economists at Goldman Sachs left their GDP growth estimate for the first quarter unchanged at a 1.3% annualized rate.
The Atlanta Fed is expecting GDP to contract in the January-March period. The economy grew at a 2.3% pace in the fourth quarter.
""Business sentiment is down and still falling, suggesting less capital spending lies ahead,"" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.

PMI data: India’s services growth recovers in February after slowing in January,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-services-pmi-february-hsbc-india-services-pmi-india-gdp-growth-fy25-india-manufacturing-pmi-february-11741162789281.html,"New Delhi: India's services sector expanded faster in February after growing at its slowest pace in more than two years during January, a private survey released on Wednesday showed.
The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by S&P Global, rose to 59 in February from 56.5 in January, remaining comfortably above the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. The index stood at 59.3 in December, 58.4 in November, 58.5 in October, and 57.7 in September.
According to the survey, new orders placed with Indian services companies rose faster during February, boosted by improving domestic and international demand.

""The uptick in growth underpinned a quicker expansion in output and a substantial increase in employment,"" the survey said. ""Although firms noted that cost burdens rose further, the rate of inflation receded to a four-month low. Meanwhile, the rate of increase in output prices was broadly similar to January and therefore remained above its long-run average,"" it added.
According to Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, global demand, which grew at its fastest pace in six months according to the new export business index, played a major role in driving output growth for India’s services sector in February.
""Meanwhile, job creation and charge inflation remained strong during February,"" Bhandari said. ""Looking ahead, business sentiment remains broadly positive, but did slightly slip last month to its lowest level since August 2024,"" she added.
India’s services sector—a pillar of its economy—accounts for more than half of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).
The Indian economy expanded by 8.2% in FY24, buoyed by 7.8% growth in the January-March 2024 quarter and surpassing the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) 7% projection for the fiscal year.
However, momentum slowed the following year. GDP growth eased to 6.7% in the first quarter of FY25, its slowest pace in five quarters, before further decelerating to 5.4% in the second quarter—the slowest in nearly two years—amid sluggish manufacturing, subdued urban consumption, and lacklustre corporate earnings.

India’seconomic growthengine saw a revival in the December quarter (Q3FY25), recovering from a low in the September quarter. Yet, the 6.2% GDP growth reported was the slowest since Q4FY23, barring one quarter—the previous one (Q2), when it came in at 5.6% (revised estimate).
India’s finance ministry recently said it expects the economy to grow at 6.4% in FY25, while the RBI estimates 6.6% growth, aided by rural consumption, government investment, and strong services exports.
Meanwhile, India’s manufacturing growth fell in February after rising to a six-month high in January, as sales and output growth retreated to a 14-month low.
The HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), compiled by S&P Global, fell to 56.3 in February from 57.7 in January. It was 56.4 in December and 56.5 in November. The February PMI number was based on responses from 400 manufacturers.
The HSBC India Composite Output Index rose from 57.7 to 58.8, indicating a substantial rate of expansion.
""The acceleration in growth was centred in the service economy, as manufacturers registered a slower upturn,"" the survey said. ""Private sector sales rose at a sharp rate that was quicker than in January. February's acceleration reflected a pick-up in growth of new business among services companies,"" it added.

"Charting the Global Economy: Fed, BOJ and BOE Hold Rates as Tariffs Loom",https://www.livemint.com/economy/charting-the-global-economy-fed-boj-and-boe-hold-rates-as-tariffs-loom-11742636384718.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Central bankers in the US, Japan and UK held the line on interest rates this past week, opting for a patient policy approach in order to gauge the economic and inflationary impacts of tariffs.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell downplayed mounting growth concerns and the price hits that could be on the way from President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policy. The Bank of Japan added a reference to trade policies to its list of risks to the outlook, its statement showed Wednesday.
Meantime, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey urged his rate-setting colleagues to tread carefully in the face of a turbulent global backdrop.
For more on tariffs, run NEWS ON TARIFFS on the Terminal. And stay up to date with Bloomberg’s Tariff Tracker.
Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy, markets and geopolitics:
World
Outside of the major central banks, the Riksbank in Sweden kept its benchmark rate unchanged at a two-year low and reiterated it’s finished with the easing cycle. Taiwan kept rates at the highest level since 2008, while South Africa, Indonesia, Angola, Armenia, Russia and Paraguay also stood pat. Chinese banks held their lending rates steady for a fifth month. Switzerland, Iceland and Morocco lowered rates.
Trump’s trade policies have abruptly set the world onto a path of slower growth and higher inflation that could worsen notably if tensions escalate. The OECD expects the pace of global expansion to slow to 3.1% this year and 3% in 2026 as barriers restrain commerce and surging uncertainty holds back business investment and consumer spending.
The US is about to be flooded with a massive wave of copper as a worldwide dash to front-run potential tariffs comes to a head. Between 100,000 and 150,000 metric tons of refined copper is expected to arrive in the US in the coming weeks, according to four people surveyed by Bloomberg with direct knowledge of some of the shipments.
US
Fed officials held their benchmark interest rate steady for a second straight meeting, caught between mounting concerns that the economy is slowing and inflation could remain stubbornly high. Chair Jerome Powell downplayed those risks and even revived a once-abandoned term to say the inflationary impact of tariffs is likely to be transitory.
Retail sales rose by less than forecast in February and the prior month was revised lower, indicating a pullback in consumer spending at the start of the year.
Europe
In the most hawkish decision in six months, two BOE rate-setters that have supported lower borrowing costs at the previous three meetings — Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor — voted for no change in policy, as did Catherine Mann who shocked markets by backing a bumper half-point reduction in February. Arch-dove Swati Dhingra voted for a quarter-point cut, scaling back her February call for half a point.
Euro-area inflation slowed more than initially reported in February, strengthening arguments for the European Central Bank to keep cutting interest rates. With the outlook for economic expansion and inflation in Europe clouded by uncertainty, ECB officials debating whether to pause or lower borrowing costs again next month may be tempted to focus on the clear progress in reaching their 2% target.
Investor confidence in Germany’s economy soared by the most in more than two years as the country prepares for hundreds of billions of euros of infrastructure and military investments under its new government.
Asia
Chinese consumption, investment and industrial production exceeded estimates to start the year, pointing to signs of resilience for an economy still in need of more stimulus as Trump’s tariffs threaten growth. At the same time, the property market stayed under pressure and unemployment rose, a sign of vulnerabilities that could be exposed if US tariffs inflict more pain across China’s manufacturing sector.
South Korea’s semiconductor exports to China plunged last month, deepening concerns about a cooling in global demand already threatened by US tariffs, as Washington steps up its restrictions on technology supplies to Beijing.
India is about to join the worldwide wave of steel protectionism, outlining plans for sweeping trade tariffs just a week after Trump slapped duties on all US imports. The global steel market is facing upheaval as multiple nations put up defences to fight a flood of metal, particularly from billion-ton producer China.
Emerging Markets
The pain in Indonesia is being felt in other emerging economies, and it’s only set to get worse: Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on China even higher, after hiking them by 20% since taking office in January. This means the country’s exporters, by far the most competitive in the world, are looking to replace any lost orders—a dynamic that risks unleashing an even larger flood of Chinese goods around the globe.
Central banks in South Africa, Egypt and several other African nations will pronounce on interest rates over the course of the next month and stake out different approaches to counter the risks posed by US protectionist policies.
Turkish markets buckled on Wednesday after the detention of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s most prominent rival stoked concern that political upheaval risks undermining recent investor-friendly economic policies. Stocks plummeted and investors dumped government debt after the detention of 54-year-old Ekrem Imamoglu, the popular mayor of Istanbul and a top contender for the presidency.

"India to scrap digital ad tax, easing US concerns",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-to-scrap-digital-ad-tax-easing-us-concerns-11742909875136.html,"New Delhi:India will scrap a tax of 6% on digital advertisements online, thefinance ministersaid on Tuesday, easing costs for U.S. tech giants such as Alphabet's Google, Meta and Amazon as a way of soothing U.S. trade concerns.
The move responds to concerns raised by Washington after President Donald Trump threatened reciprocal tariffs from April 2 on trading partners, including India, that fuelled alarm among exporters.
Finance MinisterNirmala Sitharamanunveiled the change while introducing amendments to the 2025 Finance Bill in the lower house of parliament, which approved the tax measures in the budget.
""(I) have proposed to remove (the) 6% equalization levy for advertisements,"" she told parliament.
The decision on the levy takes effect from April 1, a government source said earlier, speaking on condition of anonymity.
During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit last month to the United States, both nations agreed to work on the first phase of a trade deal by autumn 2025, targeting two-way trade of $500 billion by 2030.
India's 6% equalisation levy, or digital tax, affects online advertising services provided by foreign companies, requiring them to withhold and remit the tax to the government.
The United States Trade Representative (USTR) had criticised the levy targeting U.S. companies as ""discriminatory and unreasonable"", arguing that domestic companies were exempt.
A U.S. delegation led by Brendan Lynch, the assistant U.S. trade representative for South and Central Asia, is visiting India this week for talks with officials.
Last year, New Delhi abolished a levy of 2% on non-resident e-commerce firms for providing online services.
Analysts said the new measure was likely to provide relief to U.S. tech companies.
The decision signals an attempt to ease trade tension with the United States, said Amit Maheshwari, tax partner at AKM Global.
""However, it remains to be seen whether this step, coupled with ongoing diplomatic efforts, will lead to any softening of the U.S. stance,"" he added.

GDP revision gives govt extra fiscal headroom for FY25 accounts; second supplementary demands next week,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-gdp-revision-second-supplementary-demands-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-fiscal-deficit-target-india-gdp-11741245517133.html,"New Delhi: The union government, which is preparing to seek Parliament’s approval for additional funding for the current financial year, now has extra fiscal headroom on account of the improvement in the economic growth rate to 9.9% in nominal terms, as forecast last Friday by the statistics ministry.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the second supplementary demands for grants – requests for Parliament’s permission for additional spending in the current year – when the budget session reconvenes on 10 March, according to two people familiar with the development.
The slight upward revision in the economic growth rate projection – from 9.7% in January – allows the government to have a slightly larger fiscal deficit in absolute terms without breaching the target of 4.8% of nominal GDP set for the current financial year.

That headroom could be as much as₹19,400 crore. In the budget presented on 1 February, the government kept a fiscal deficit of₹15.69 trillion for the current financial year, based on the first advance estimate of economic growth, which was revised upwards on 28 February.
However, limited additional funds will be sought and a large part of it will be met through savings from various schemes within individual ministries, said one of the people quoted above.
According to the Controller General of Accounts (CGA), the government’s principal accountant, the departments of fertilisers, coal, agricultural research and education, posts, consumer affairs, public distribution, health and family welfare, health research, and the ministries of power, railways and defence had spent more than 80% of their allocation for the current financial year by the end of January. Some of these departments and ministries will need additional funds through the re-allocating of savings from the same arm of the government or others.
Also read:Divestments may bring₹10,000 cr for govt in this financial year
The government’s total spending stood at₹35.7 trillion at the end of January, three-fourth of its₹47.1 trillion target. By then, fertiliser subsidy payouts were at 94% of the₹1.71 trillion earmarked in the revised estimates, while food subsidy payouts were at 86% of the₹1.97 trillion earmarked for the year. At₹23.7 trillion, total revenue receipts were at 77% of the₹30.8 trillion revised estimate.
Experts Mint spoke to said the 4.8% fiscal deficit target for the current year was achievable. “The implication of upward GDP revision in nominal terms is that it allows a higher fiscal deficit in absolute terms without breaching the target as a share of GDP. The 4.8% fiscal deficit target for the current year is really achievable. The originally budgeted capital expenditure for the current year has been revised down in the revised estimates, which reduces expenditure pressures,” said D K Srivastava, EY’s chief policy advisor.
The budget presented on 1 February lowered the union government’s capital expenditure, excluding grants to states for asset creation, from the original estimate of₹11.1 trillion to₹10.18 trillion for the current year, as last year’s general election had slowed down spending.

The budget also set a new target of lowering its debt from 57.1% in FY25 to 50% of GDP, give or take 1%, by 31 March, 2031. The annual fiscal deficit will be calibrated to achieve this target. “It is desirable to have a sharper debt-GDP target because, even at 50%, the government’s interest payment burden would be very high. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) target was to lower it to 40%,” said Srivastava.
Queries emailed to the finance ministry on Wednesday remained unanswered at the time of publishing.

"GST kitty grows 10 pc in March to  ₹1.96 lakh cr, second-highest ever",https://www.livemint.com/economy/gst-kitty-grows-10-pc-in-march-to-rs-1-96-lakh-cr-second-highest-ever-11743508229660.html,"New Delhi, Apr 1 (PTI) Gross GST collection grew 9.9 per cent in March to over₹1.96 lakh crore - the second-highest mop-up ever, government data showed on Tuesday.
GST revenue from domestic transactions rose 8.8 per cent to₹1.49 lakh crore, while revenue from imported goods was higher 13.56 per cent to₹46,919 crore.
The gross collection includes Central GST mop-up of₹38,145 crore, State GST collection of₹49,891 crore and Integrated GST (IGST) of₹95,853 crore. Cess collection during March stood at₹12,253 crore.
Total refunds during March rose 41 per cent to₹19,615 crore.
After adjusting refunds, net GST revenue stood at over₹1.76 lakh crore in March 2025, a 7.3 per cent growth over the year-ago period.
GST collection had hit a record high of₹2.10 lakh crore in April 2024.
Deloitte India Partner MS Mani said the 9.9 per cent increase in gross GST collection for the month reflects the impact of year-end sales push by businesses.
""It is very encouraging to see that this is not an isolated instance as GST collections have shown a steady increase every month reflected by the 9.4 per cent increase in annual Gross GST collections,"" Mani said.
Gross GST collection during April-March stood at₹22.08 lakh crore, a 9.4 per cent Y-o-Y growth.
""There continues to be a wide variation in the growth rates of GST collections across key manufacturing and consuming states . While states like Maharashtra, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan have shown a growth exceeding 10 per cent, other states like Gujarat, Karnataka, Telengana, AP, Tamil Nadu have been in the range of -1 per cent to 7 per cent, which is very unusual for the month of March. There is a need to understand the reasons for the same by evaluating the sectoral growth and compliance rates in these states,"" Mani said.
KPMG in India, Partner and Head, Indirect Tax, Abhishek Jain said, a nearly 10 per cent growth in collections compared to last year reflects economic stability and strong tax compliance by companies.
""With fiscal year-end adjustments and reconciliations underway, we can expect a further surge in month-on-month growth in the next set of collection,"" Jain added.

"US labor market steady, tariffs and federal government layoffs a risk to outlook",https://www.livemint.com/economy/us-labor-market-steady-tariffs-and-federal-government-layoffs-a-risk-to-outlook-11741286086548.html,"*
Weekly jobless claims fall 21,000 to 221,000
*
Federal employees claims highest in four years
*
Planned layoffs soar to 172,017 in February on DOGE boost
*
Trade deficit widens to record high amid imports surge
By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON, - The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, suggesting that the labor market remained stable in February, though turbulence lies ahead from tariffs on imports and deep government spending cuts.
That was flagged by other data on Thursday showing layoffs announced by U.S.-based employers jumped in February to levels not seen since the last two recessions amid mass federal government job cuts, canceled contracts and fears of trade wars.
""Evidence is mounting that elevated uncertainty about the outlook for federal policies and still-tight monetary policy is pushing redundancies higher,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000 for the week ended March 1, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 235,000 claims for the latest week.
The decline reversed the prior week's surge, which had lifted claims to a two-month high and was blamed on snowstorms and difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations around the Presidents Day holiday.
A separate unemployment compensation for federal employees program, which is reported with a one-week lag, showed applications rising to a four-year high of 1,634 from only 614 during the week ending February 15.
Tech billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has fired probationary federal government workers. President Donald Trump has described the federal government as bloated and wasteful.
Global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said it had tracked 62,242 announced job cuts by the federal government from 17 different agencies in February. Most of the layoffs have been in Washington D.C., which has lost 61,795 jobs so far this year compared to only 60 in 2024.
Contractors have also been caught in the DOGE crossfire, extending the job losses to the private sector.
Challenger said the ""DOGE impact"" was blamed for 63,583 of the announced 172,017 layoffs last month.
For now, the overall labor market continues to plod along.
The Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"" report on Wednesday described employment as having ""nudged slightly higher on balance"" since mid-January. Labor market stability is critical to the U.S. central bank's ability to keep interest rates unchanged while policymakers monitor the economic impact of tariffs and an immigration crackdown.
The Fed left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.50% range in January, having reduced it by 100 basis points since September, when it embarked on its policy easing cycle. The policy rate was hiked by 5.25 percentage points in 2022 and 2023 to tame inflation.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, advanced 42,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.897 million during the week ending February 22, the claims report showed.
Stocks on Wall Street traded lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
RECORD HIGH TRADE DEFICIT
The federal government layoffs are not expected to show up in February's employment report, due on Friday, as the layoffs happened outside the survey week.
But the hiring and funding freezes could have an impact on government and contractor employment.
Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 160,000 jobs after rising 143,000 in January, a Reuters survey showed. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 4.0%.
A third report from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis showed the trade deficit widened 34.0% to an all-time high of $131.4 billion in January as businesses rushed to bring in merchandise ahead of import duties.
The percentage change was the largest since March 2015 and put trade on track to subtract from gross domestic product in the first quarter. Trump this week slapped a new 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada and doubled duties on Chinese goods to 20%, triggering a trade war.
The goods trade deficit with Canada hit a record high in January. The gap widened further with China and rose slightly with Mexico. On Thursday, Trump said Mexico won't be required to pay tariffs on any goods that fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade until April 2, as the administration's trade policy continues to evolve.
Imports soared 10.0%, the most since July 2020, to $401.2 billion. Goods imports increased a record 12.3% to an all-time high of $329.5 billion. They were driven by a $23.1 billion increase in imports of industrial supplies and materials, mostly reflecting finished metal shapes, probably gold.
There were large increases in consumer goods imports like pharmaceutical preparations, cell phones and other household goods. Imports of capital goods including computers, computer accessories and telecommunications equipment also rose. Imports of services climbed $0.4 billion to $71.7 billion.
Exports rose 1.2% to $269.8 billion. Goods exports increased 1.6% to $172.8 billion, boosted by capital goods like civilian aircraft and engines as well as semiconductors and computers. Consumer goods also rose, driven by pharmaceutical preparations and jewelry. But exports of other goods dropped $1.3 billion.
Food exports fell $1.0 billion amid a decline in soybeans. Exports of services increased $0.6 billion to $97.0 billion.
The inflation-adjusted goods trade deficit shot up 27.5% to a record $142.9 billion. This deterioration and decline in consumer spending in January have raised the risk of a contraction in GDP in the first quarter.
But some economists still expect moderate growth, arguing that gold accounted for much of the surge in imports.
Mining.com reported in January traders in London were rushing to ship gold to the U.S. to avoid tariff risks and capture premium prices. Gold imports, not intended for official reserve purposes, are excluded from national accounts.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting GDP declining at a 2.8% annualized rate this quarter. The economy grew at a 2.3% rate in the October-December quarter.
""Trade will very likely stay in the spotlight this year,""
said Oren Klachkin, financial markets economist at Nationwide.

"GST rate cut soon, tax review in final stages, says FM Nirmala Sitharaman",https://www.livemint.com/economy/gst-rate-cut-soon-tax-review-in-final-stages-says-fm-11741446945278.html,"Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is in the final stages of reviewing GST structure and a reduction of the levy would happen soon, union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who chairs the Federal indirect tax body said on Saturday.
Speaking at the Economics Times Awards for Corporate Excellence in Mumbai, Sitharaman said that the ministerial group set up by the GST Council has done excellent work, which is in final stages now and that the minister would take one more look at the proposals and take it to the federal indirect tax body for decision making. This is expected to be taken up at the next meeting of the Council.
“We are very close to coming to a final call on some of the very critical issues—reduction, rationalisation of rates and looking at the number of slabs and so on,” said the minister, adding that the rates at present are lower than what they were when the indirect tax reform was rolled out in 2017.
The GST Council chaired by the union finance minister has designated state ministers as members.
GST rates have come down since the law was implemented in 2017, and the currently ongoing revision is also likely to lower the levy further, the union finance minister said.
""At the time when the GST was launched, the revenue-neutral rate was about 15.8%,"" said Sitharaman.
Revenue-neutral rate refers to a rate of GST that would result in collecting the same amount of revenue before and after the GST roll-out from the items covered by the new tax system. It would not increase the cost of a product for a consumer, while also maintaining the revenue generated by the government through the levy.
""Since after the launch of GST, and till 2023, we had already brought that 15.8% to 11.4%, which means the rates have come down....So the clue that you are looking for is -- it will come down even further,"" Sitharaman said.
Sitharaman also asked industries to voice their opinions about investment to the government, at a time when private sector investments were concentrated in only a few sectors of the economy.
The union finance minister also said it would be unwise for her to comment on the issue of foreign institutional investors selling off stakes in Indian stock markets due to elevated capitals gains tax, as the parliament's budget session had not come to an end.
The parliament is set to resume the Budget session on Monday, 10 March. Finance minister Sitharaman hiked the country's long-term capital gains tax by 25% to 12.5% in July 2024 budget.
Sitharaman said the sentiment of faith in India's potential was ""missing"", leading to a growth rate of about 6.5-6.7% for FY26. She added that such a belief would enable India to grow at about 8% for the next fiscal.
Sitharaman said India was still the fastest growing economy in the world, at a sustained 6.5-7% growth in all post-Covid years, and across all sectors.
The economy, like capital markets, is also driven by sentiment, Sitharaman said. ""If sentiments can govern our markets and therefore all of us will be buoyed at one point and completely watered down at the other, so is the economy,"" she said.
The finance minister said dumping of goods into India is a concern, at a time when tariffs are being used aggressively. But, there cannot be complete stoppage of imports, as these imports are cheaper for small manufacturers, Sitharaman said.
The action taken against dumping of cheap goods should be after considering the inputs from all stakeholders, including small businesses, the finance minister said.
Finance minister Sitharaman said the union commerce ministry is currently engaged in reviewing multiple trade agreements and that were signed in the past, as these agreements allowed many foreign goods to enter Indian markets unregulated. She said these agreements were speedily concluded, and often had loose language.
""Today the commerce ministry is engaged in reviewing many of the FTAs signed, whether it is with Japan, whether it is with Korea, whether it is with ASEAN"", said Sitharaman.
""...there is just a flood of goods coming in that you are not able to regulate. Duties don't make a difference to them because the FTAs allows it,"" she added.
FTA refers to Free Trade Agreements, and ASEAN refers to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Current negotiations over free trade or bilateral agreements included the lessons learnt from previous such agreements, she said, adding that putting India's interest first was a priority in such negotiations.
""Unless you negotiate for India's own good, even your negotiation will not be taken seriously by the other side because they are very clear on what they want,"" she said.
Ensuring that India's interests are included in the agreement, increasing the number of bilateral agreements, and keeping the language of the agreement such that disputes are avoided are the key principles which will be followed by India in trade negotiations, Sitharaman said.
Sitharaman also said the World Trade Organisation was ineffective in resolving trade disputes, making the clarity of language in bilateral agreements more important amid tariff uncertainties.

India will have sufficient sugar at the start of next season; minimum selling price of sugar must be hiked: ISMA,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-will-have-sufficient-sugar-at-the-start-of-next-season-minimum-selling-price-of-sugar-must-be-hiked-isma-11741077109875.html,"New Delhi [India], March 4 (ANI): India will have sufficient sugar at the start of the next marketing season, which starts in October 2025, Deepak Ballani, Director General of Indian Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA), told ANI.
In a telephone interview, Ballani explained India would have some 60-odd lakh tonnes of sugar available as opening stock for the next marketing season, against the standard norms of 50-55 lakh tonnes.
According to him, the opening stock of the 2024-25 marketing season was 80 lakh tonnes. The sugar production estimate for 2024-25 is 272 lakh tonnes, which is some 15 per cent lower year-on-year from 320 lakh tonnes produced in 2023-24.
The opening stock of 80 lakh tonnes and 272 lakh tonnes of estimated production will bring the total sugar availability to 352 lakh tonnes in 2024-25. India consumes around 280 lakh tonnes of sugar annually. This will make available about 60 lakh tonnes as the opening stock for the next season.
After restricting the sugar trade in the 2023-24 season, the central government allowed sugar producers to export 1 million tonnes of sweetener on January 21 this year.
The government restricted sugar exports in the previous year, presumably to maintain price stability in domestic markets.
""Even after the 10 lakh tonne exports, India will close the season at 60 lakh tonne. Normally, the government wants to keep 50-55 lakh tonnes as a normal closing stock. Even after allowing exports, we will still have a higher closing stock. That is why the government has allowed the exports,"" Ballani said.
Sugar marketing season in India runs from October to September.
""We have already done export (physical plus contracts) of about 600,000-700,000 tonne. We have a large window till September...and I think in another two months we shall be able to finish our 1 million export quota,"" Ballani said.
During the interview, the ISMA DG raised concerns about sugar prices in India and how they have lagged the pace at which the Fair Remunerative Price has moved.
At the moment, the ex-mill price of sugar in Maharashtra is₹3,800 per quintal, and in Uttar Pradesh at₹4,000-4,050 per quintal.
Ballani expects the domestic sugar market to be firm in the near term, with a price range of₹4000-4100 per quintal.
According to Ballani, sugar's FRP has increased at a CAGR of 5.5 percent since 2014. The government sets the FRP every year, and the mills pay farmers the FRP.
But the price of sugar has increased by only 2 percent CAGR over the past 10 years, he said. The average retail price of sugar has been almost stagnant for the past two years.
He also pointed out that the Minimum Selling Price of sugar has not been revised in the last five years. In 2019, it was set at₹31 per kg, against the estimated cost of sugar production of₹41.
""We are still below the cost of production. For us to maintain our payment to the farmers, for investments, to make sure our industry is viable, we need a decent and reasonable sugar price as well,"" he said.
He argued that India pays the highest rates to sugarcane farmers in the world but realises the lowest prices for the end product-sugar. (ANI)

"FM Sitharaman’s ‘nudge’ to come clean on foreign assets adds over  ₹30,000 crore to exchequer",https://www.livemint.com/economy/fm-sitharaman-s-nudge-to-come-clean-on-foreign-assets-adds-over-rs-30-000-crore-to-exchequer-11742910942045.html,"More than 30,000taxpayershave declared foreign assets and income worth about₹30,300 crore by filing revised income tax returns (ITRs) or belated returns under the ‘nudge’ campaign, Union Finance MinisterNirmala Sitharamansaid on Tuesday.
“We carried out a ‘nudge’ campaign in which we encouraged taxpayers to voluntarily disclose their foreign income and assets. SMS and emails were sent to around 19,501 selected taxpayers, asking them to review their income tax returns filed for 2024-25 based on information available to the Income Tax Department regarding foreign deposits,” Sitharaman announced in the Lok Sabha.
Out of 19,501 taxpayers, a total of 11,162 revised their returns and filled out the Schedule Foreign Assets form, declaring total assets worth₹11,259.29 crore and disclosing foreign income of₹154.42 crore, she added.
The finance minister also stated that 883 taxpayers corrected their status from resident to non-resident in their revised income tax returns (ITRs) for the assessment year (AY) 2024-25.
Additionally, 13,516 taxpayers declared foreign assets worth₹7,564 crore and foreign income of around₹353 crore in their revised ITRs for 2024-25.
Due to the campaign, there was a “ripple effect”, she said.
“Cumulatively, this simple nudge resulted in the declaration of foreign assets worth₹29,208 crore and foreign income of₹1,089 crore (₹30,297 crore) in Schedule FA (foreign assets) by 30,161 taxpayers,” thefinance ministersaid.
She further said that the nudge campaign on overseas property holdings has yielded positive results, with taxpayers disclosing their assets and paying the dues owed.
In line with its ‘trust-first’ approach, theCentral Board of Direct Taxes(CBDT) on November 16 last year, launched an awareness campaign under which messages were sent to taxpayers who had not disclosed high-value foreign income or assets in their ITRs for AY 2024-25.
The income tax department sent SMSs and emails to 19,501 taxpayers with high foreign account balances or significant foreign income from interest or dividends above a specified threshold.
These communications requested taxpayers to revise their ITRs to reflect their foreign assets and income accurately.
About 62 per cent of nudged taxpayers responded positively, voluntarily revising their ITRs to declare foreign assets and income, a report by news agency PTI said citing sources earlier this month.
The number of taxpayers disclosing foreign assets and income on a voluntary basis has steadily grown from 60,000 in AY 2021-22 to 231,452 taxpayers in AY 2024-25.
Due to extensive outreach and awareness efforts, voluntary disclosures witnessed a significant 45.17 per cent growth in AY 2024-25 when compared to AY 2023-24.
Sitharaman on Tuesday also said that the Finance Bill 2025 offered unprecedented tax relief, and the 13.14 per cent projected growth in personal income tax collection is ""realistic"".
“The Finance Bill provides unprecedented tax relief to honour taxpayer... We have recognised the contribution of the middle class,” she said in the parliament.
In the 2025-26 Budget, the government has hiked income tax rebate to₹12 lakh per annum from₹7 lakh earlier.
For the salaried class, this rebate will be₹12.75 lakh per year after taking into account the standard deduction.

Donald Trump tariffs: Why US citizens worry about future coffee and vanilla supply in their kitchens — explained,https://www.livemint.com/economy/donald-trump-tariffs-us-citizens-worry-about-future-coffee-vanilla-supply-kitchens-explained-black-monday-economy-news-11744016690297.html,"United States PresidentDonald Trump's recent tariff announcements have wrecked havoc on the global markets, affecting equities, commodities and cryptocurrencies. Amid these developments, many US consumers are concerned about the potential impact on their daily kitchen staples, particularly coffee and vanilla.
Many are especially concerned about coffee andvanillasupplies in the US, given the significantly high tariff rates imposed on the trading nations — 46 per cent on Vietnam and 47 per cent on Madagascar, respectively.
Madagascar, on which the US has imposed a 47 per cent tariff, produces close to 80 per cent of the world's vanilla supplies. The bulk of the UScoffeeimports come from Vietnam.
But, you may ask, can't the US grow its own vanilla and coffee? The short answer is no. The longer answer is that while it could grow some, these quantities would never be enough to meet demand.
Scientist Simon Maechling explained on X (formerly known as Twitter), “You cannot grow coffee and vanilla in the US. Vanilla takes 3 years to flower, 9 months per pod, needs hand pollination. Coffee needs 3–4 years to yield beans.”
Besides the time and effort required to grow vanilla and coffeecrops, the US also lacks another important factor — weather. Maechling added: “Both demand tropical heat and humidity. Not hype — just reality.”
Notably, one user in Maechling's comments sought additional information from Grok AI, asking if there are any coffee and vanilla producers in the US. To which the AI model replied: “Yes, coffee and vanilla are grown in the US Coffee thrives inHawaii(Kona), California, and Puerto Rico, with Hawaii producing ~11.5 million pounds (49.89 lakh kg) yearly. Vanilla is cultivated in Hawaii as a specialty crop, with research expanding it in Florida. Despite claims they can’t grow here due to climate, these regions prove otherwise on a small scale.”
When further questioned on whether supply from domestic US producers could meet US consumer demand for vanilla and coffee, Grok replied: “Coffee and vanilla can’t be grown in the US at a scale to meet national demand. The US consumes 3.5B lbs of coffee yearly, but produces only ~11.5M lbs, mostly in Hawaii—less than 0.4%. Vanilla imports are ~7.66M lbs, with domestic output likely in the thousands, mainly from Hawaii andFlorida. Both need tropical climates and, for vanilla, labor-intensive pollination, limiting large-scale US production. Imports are essential.”
On further prompting, it added: “It's not impossible, just currently unfeasible. The US could theoretically grow coffee and vanilla with tech like advanced greenhouses, but climate, labor costs, and scale make it impractical now. Future innovations might change this, but not soon.”
There are two likely winners here, and they are not domestic US producers. For coffee,Brazilis the most likely winner. While Vietnam (supplying robusta coffee) faces 46 per cent tariffs on all imports to the US and could likely see demand fall due to the resultant price hike, Brazil has “gotten away” with a comparatively lower 10 per cent tariff. It is also already the second largest supplier of coffee (arabica) to the US after the Southeast Asian country.
For vanilla, theEuropean Unioncould take over the mantle from Madagascar, according to a report by Irish publicationThe Journal.
This is not because the EU grows vanilla but by using simple trade. The EU has a minimum 20 per cent blanket tariff on all exports to the US, well below the 47 per cent imposed on Madagascar. The report noted that in the future, the US may find it cheaper to import vanilla from Europe — which will, in turn, buy its stock fromMadagascar!
“In that sense, European countries could make the tariffs work for them,” the report said. Brian Malone of Dublin Spice Company told the publication that they already buy 50-150kg of vanilla at a time from Papua New Guinea and sell it to France, Germany, and the Netherlands. A similar plan could work with the US.

EPFO achieves historic high of 2.16 crore auto-claims in FY25,https://www.livemint.com/economy/epfo-achieves-historic-high-of-2-16-crore-auto-claims-in-fy25-11742208234058.html,"New Delhi [India], March 17 (ANI): EPFO achieved a historic high of 2.16 crore auto-claims settlement so far during the current financial year, up from 89.52 lakh in 2023-24, Union Minister of State for Labour & Employment, Shobha Karandlaje informed Lok Sabha on Monday.
The minister in a written reply in the Lok Sabha informed that the auto-mode claims are processed within three days.
Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has taken several steps to streamline the process of claim settlement.
For auto mode processing of advance claims, the amount limit has been enhanced to₹1 lakh.
Further, in addition to illness/hospitalization advances, the advances for housing, education and marriage are also enabled for auto mode processing.
""Now, 60 per cent of advance claims are processed are in auto mode,"" the minister stated in her written reply.
Member details correction process has been simplified, and members having Aadhaar-verified UANs can make corrections in their IDs themselves, without any EPFO interventions.
""At present, about 96 per cent corrections are being done without any EPF office intervention,"" stated the minister.
As high as 99.31 per cent claims are now received in online mode, without any requirement to visit the field office.
In 2024-25, as on March 6, 2025, 7.14 crore claims have been filed in online mode.
""In transfer claim submission requests, the need for employer's attestation of Aadhaar-verified UANs has been done away with. Now only 10 per cent transfer claims require member and employer's attestation,"" the minister stated.
The minister apprised the Parliament that EPFO has also provided de-linking facilities to the members, whose EPF accounts have been erroneously/fraudulently linked by the establishments.
Since its launch on January 18, 2025, more than 55,000 members have de-linked their accounts till the end of February, 2025.
Certain upfront validations have been developed to guide members about eligibility/admissibility of claims so as to ensure that members do not file ineligible claims. (ANI)

India’s services sector growth moderates in March,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-services-pmi-growth-hsbc-india-services-pmi-manufacturing-pmi-economy-gdp-growth-march-11743755259090.html,"India’s services sector growth eased in March, weighed down by a slight slowdown in business activity and sales, while international orders saw their weakest expansion in 15 months, according to a private survey released on Friday.
The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by S&P Global, declined to 58.5 in March from 59 in February and 56.5 in January while remaining well above the 50-point threshold that separates expansion from contraction.
The index stood at 59.3 in December, 58.4 in November, 58.5 in October, and 57.7 in September.
According to the survey, March saw the slowest increase in external orders since December 2023.
However, cost pressures receded to a five-month low, which, coupled with competitive conditions, curbed charge inflation, the survey said, adding that prices charged for the provision of services rose at the weakest rate since September 2021.
""Although below February's reading of 59.0, the headline index remained above its long-run average (54.2),"" the survey added.
According to Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, India's services PMI eased to 58.5 in March 2025, slightly lower than the previous month as domestic and international demand remained strong, though marginally softer sequentially.
""India recorded a 58.5 services PMI in March 2025, softening slightly from the month prior. Domestic and international demand remained fairly buoyant, despite being sequentially a tick lower than the month before,"" Bhandari said.
""Meanwhile, job creation and charge inflation both cooled during March. Looking ahead, business sentiment remains generally positive, but intensifying competition presents a significant challenge to many survey participants,"" she added.
India’s services sector—a pillar of its economy—accounts for more than half of its gross domestic product (GDP).
The Indian economy expanded by 8.2% in 2023-24, buoyed by 7.8% growth in the January-March 2024 quarter and surpassing the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) 7% projection for the fiscal year.
However, momentum slowed the following year. GDP growth eased to 6.7% in the first quarter of 2024-25, its slowest pace in five quarters, before further decelerating to 5.4% in the second quarter—the slowest in nearly two years—amid sluggish manufacturing, subdued urban consumption, and lacklustre corporate earnings.
India’s economic growth engine saw a revival in the December quarter (Q3FY25), recovering from a low in the September quarter. Yet, the 6.2% GDP growth reported was the slowest since Q4FY23, barring one quarter—the previous one (Q2), when it came in at 5.6% (revised estimate).
India’s finance ministry recently said it expects the economy to grow at 6.5% in 2024-25, while the RBI estimates 6.6% growth, aided by rural consumption, government investment, and strong services exports.
India’s manufacturing sector expanded at its fastest pace in eight months in March, driven by strong demand and a sharp rise in output.
The HSBC India Manufacturing PMI, compiled by S&P Global, rose to 58.1 in March from 56.3 in February and 57.7 in January. The index was 56.4 in December and 56.5 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
The HSBC India Composite Output Index increased to a seven-month high of 59.5 in March, from 58.8 in February, to signal another month of above-trend growth.
""For both new business and output, rates of expansion were stronger in the manufacturing sector, where there was a pick-up in growth. Despite seeing a slowdown, service providers still registered substantial increases,"" the survey said.
""Business confidence and job creation nevertheless softened among goods producers and services companies,"" it added.

Trump Tariffs LIVE: Donald Trump to make new tariff announcement at 2000 GMT on April 2,https://www.livemint.com/economy/trump-tariffs-live-us-flags-indias-rising-import-duty-barriers-ahead-of-liberation-day-deadline-11743501837527.html,"Donald Trump Tariffs LIVE:The United States President, Donald Trump, is set to unveil a new set of tariffs for nations worldwide on Wednesday, April 2. Trump also branded the date as “Liberation Day,” when the administration seeks to boost domestic manufacturing, among other things.
The Trump administration aims to announce the so-called reciprocal tariffs, rebalance global trade, boost the US domestic manufacturing power, and overall generate substantial revenues for prioritising domestic policies.
While critics have cautined that tariffs will only increase the burden on US consumers as importers would simply pass on the cost, Donald Trump insists they will bring a “rebirth” of American businesses. For now, with all the uncertainities ahead, it is a wait and watch game.
Multiple US media reports speculate that Donald Trump may impose a blanket 20 per cent tariffs or even look to negotiate preferential treatment for some countries.
According to the White House, the finer points are still being discussed, but as per the report, the aim would be to tackle what it calls “trade imbalances” between the US and other countries — friends and foes alike.
Notably, neither Donald Trump nor his administration has specified the scope of the latest announcements, but he has repeatedly stressed on “reciprocation” and had earlier promised a “golden age” for American businesses and put a “stop” to being “ripped off”, as per the AFP report.
According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the new tariffs would come into effect “immediately” after roll-out on April 2, AFP reported.
She added that Donald Trump was meeting his top advisors on the eve of the announcement, “perfecting it to make sure this is a perfect deal”.
According to the White House, Donald Trump is set to make his announcement in the Rose Garden of the White House at 4 pm local time on April 2 — this is 8 pm GMT and around 1.30 am IST on April 3.
The announcement time has been set for after Wall Street markets close in the US. However, Asian markets will open hours later, and are expected to tell the impact story first.
Canada's Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre on Wednesday escalated his criticism of Donald Trump, outlining plans to confront a US president he said cannot be trusted to honor agreements.
Hours before Trump was set to unveil sweeping tariffs that could punish the Canadian economy, Poilievre addressed an audience of business leaders in downtown Toronto, the epicenter of Canada's financial industry.
Polling ahead of Canada's April 28 election indicates Poilievre has struggled to establish himself as a forceful counter to Trump, whose trade war and repeated threats to annex Canada have shattered bilateral relations.
Poilievre said if elected to replace Liberal Party leader Mark Carney as prime minister he would immediately ask Trump to launch negotiations on a new trade agreement.
""I will propose that both countries pause tariffs while we hammer out that deal,"" Poilievre said.
But, he added, Canada cannot assume Trump will keep his word. –AFP
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and domestic businesses are braced for the impact of US President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, which have the potential to derail the government’s hopes for economic growth.
The UK’s FTSE 100 fell slightly on Wednesday in anticipation of Trump’s announcement due at 9pm, which is expected to slap import taxes on goods arriving in the US from around the world.
The car industry has already learned its fate, with a 25% tariff on vehicles sent to the US – something which could cost an estimated 25,000 jobs in the UK.
The prime minister has said he expects the UK will be hit and Chancellor Rachel Reeves warned Cabinet ministers there would be an economic impact from the tariffs.
The trade war that US President Donald Trump has escalated in his second term is a challenge for all Asian economies, large and small, in an era when the most populous region of the world is expected to drive global economic growth.
Export manufacturing and free trade helped transform China and other Asian countries into economic powerhouses over the past decades. Trump's barrages of tariffs, aimed at compelling companies to keep or set up their factories in the United States, are rupturing trade agreements often made at great political cost to trading partners.
The White House said the criteria for raising tariffs will include not just US trade deficits but also various taxes, exchange rates, government subsidies and various non-tariff trade barriers. --AP
Willkie Farr & Gallagher, the law firm of Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff, is committing at least $100 million in pro bono work to causes aligned to “conservative ideals”, according to US President Donald Trump.
The law firm's chairman Thomas Cerabino said on Truth: “We reached an agreement with President Trump and his administration on matters of great importance to our firm. The substance of that agreement is consistent with our Firm’s views on access to legal representation by clients including pro bono clients.”
Japan's Nikkei index was a mixed bag on April 2, as traders await the latest round of tariffs from US President Donald Trump, according to a Reuters report.
The Nikkei at one point slipped 0.56 per cent to 35,426.33 — its lowest since September 11, 2024, after opening 0.36 per cent higher at the session's high of 35,751.02. It traded flat at 35,630.18 as of 0153 GMT, the report added.
Oil prices steadied on April 2, after falling in the previous session on concerns over more tariffs by Donald Trump, to be announced later today, according to a Reuters report. New US tariffs are set to deepen a global trade war that could limit crude demand, it added.
US automakers sold nearly 1.6 million vehicles in March, marking a 13.6% increase from the previous year. Total sales for the first quarter reached over 3.9 million vehicles. Almost all automakers saw a notable increase in electric vehicle sales, contributing to the overall sales rise. (AP)
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke about Canada's strategy to counter ""unjustified trade actions"" by the United States. Both leaders emphasised the need to protect North American competitiveness while respecting each nation's sovereignty. Prime Minister Carney reiterated his intention to challenge unfair trade practices by the US in future trade negotiations.
President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that Mexico will not take an ""eye for an eye"" approach to the US tariffs. Sheinbaum emphasised that while Mexico will respond to US actions, it believes in dialogue rather than escalating tensions.
The U.S. is expected to announce 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts, effective this week.
Mexico has vowed a ""comprehensive response,"" but will focus on dialogue as a key strategy. Sheinbaum indicated that Mexico would wait for the full details of Trump's announcement before formulating a response.
The White House stated that nations treating the US unfairly will face tariffs in return. The tariffs will be sweeping and reciprocal, as described by the White House. Specifics of the tariffs have not been disclosed.
President Donald Trump will announce tariffs in the Rose Garden at 2000 GMT on Wednesday, April 2 (1:30 am IST on April 3).
The White House stated that any nation treating the US unfairly should expect tariffs. President Trump is set to announce ""sweeping, reciprocal tariffs"" on Wednesday.
White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt declined to provide further details.
When asked about exemptions for farmers, Leavitt said there were ""no exemptions at this time.""
As US President Donald Trump aims to increase competitiveness in the United States, the White House announced on Tuesday, April 1, that the reciprocal tariffs will be effective immediately after Donald Trump's announcement on Wednesday, April 2, according to aReutersreport.
Two days before thereciprocal tariffsare set to affect the world, the US government, in a report cited by the news agency Reuters, said that the nation has concerns over India's rising customs barriers, import curbs, and licenses, alongside high tariff rates.
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative on Monday, March 31, disclosed a list of foreign nations whose policies and regulations the US regards as barriers to global trade. India was named one of the nations on the list for its import-quality requirements.
According to the news report, India's quality control authority, the Bureau of India Standards (BIS), since 2019, has mandated quality control in sectors like Chemicals, medical devices, batteries, electronics, food and textiles.
They have issued more than 700 quality control orders in nearly 100 sectors and also plan to issue 125 new orders in sectors like chemicals, textiles, steel, aluminium, and electric equipment, reported the agency, citing a statement from the Indian government.
Earlier, President Donald Trump called India a “tariff king” and “tariff abuser” as the South Asian nation tries to negotiate a lower rate and win over the newly elected Trump administration.
TheWhite Househas not announced any specific details on the rates of the upcoming tariffs or how they will be calculated, along with the details on which countries may qualify for exceptions.
“You’d start with all countries, so let’s see what happens,” Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. “I haven’t heard a rumor about 15 countries, 10 or 15.”
Concerns of the upcoming tariff announcement on April 2, are looming over the investors globally as they await for Donald Trump's address on the “Liberation Day.”
TheIndian stock markets took a strong hit on Tuesday, ahead of Trump's tariff announcements, as investors remained cautious over the United States' impending reciprocal tariffs on India.
The US markets, after opening lower on Monday and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting their six-month low, overall closed higher with the exception of the Nasdaq.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index closed 1 per cent higher at 42,001.76 points on Monday, compared to 41,583.90 points at the previous US market close. The S&P 500 Index closed 0.55 per cent higher at 5,611.85 points, compared to 5,580.94 points in the previous market session.
On the other hand, the Nasdaq Composite Index closed 0.14 per cent lower at 17,299.29 points after Monday's session, compared to 17,322.99 points at the previousWall Streetclose.
The first round of US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump came as an executive order on goods imported from Mexico, Canada, and China, as perMint'searlier report.
The US imposed 10 per cent tariffs on goods imported from China, while Mexico and Canada were hit with 25 per cent tariff rates.
After the nations retaliated against the US, Donald Trump paused the tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 30 days, as both nations pledged to address the issues over drug trafficking and border security on February 3, 2025.
On February 10, Donald Trump announced his plans to impose 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports into the United States.
“Very simple, they charge us, we charge them,” he said. India was one of the nations affected, as the steelmakers are currently struggling with rising imports and falling domestic prices.

"Govt seeks House nod for extra spending of  ₹51,400 crore in FY25, mainly for subsidies",https://www.livemint.com/economy/parliament-supplementary-demand-spending-fy25-budget-subsidy-debt-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-fiscal-deficit-11741604162936.html,"New Delhi:Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday sought Parliament’s approval for a net additional spending of₹51,463 crore in FY25 to meet funding requirements of mainly fertilizer, food and cooking gas subsidy and defence pension.
The government also sought House approval for an extra₹6.27 trillion spending, mainly for repayment of debt, which does not involve additional cash outgo as it is met through savings and additional revenue receipts, showed the second supplementary demands for grants tabled in Parliament.
The document shows that only about 8% of the gross additional spending for which House approval is sought entails extra cash outgo.

Of this,₹14,100 crore will go to the fertilizer subsidy,₹8,400 crore for defence pensions,₹13,400 crore to other pension requirements,₹5,300 crore to the telecom sector and over₹2,100 crore to the farm sector. The petroleum sector will get an additional₹1,000 crore, including for cooking gas subsidy for poor households.

The slight upward revision in the economic growth rate projection for FY25 made by the ministry of statistics from 9.7% in January to 9.9% last month allows the government a slightly larger fiscal deficit in absolute terms without breaching the target of 4.8% of nominal GDP set for the current financial year, Mint reported on 6 March.

In absolute terms, fiscal deficit for the current year was estimated to be₹15.69 trillion, as per revised estimates presented in February.
The Centre is expected to stick to the fiscal deficit target, aided by savings and additional receipts, as budget discipline has been a key principle of the NDA government. For the next financial year, a fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP has been set.
The Centre’s tax collection so far has been robust. Up to 11 February, it had collected₹17.78 trillion in direct taxes after adjusting for refunds, a near 15% annual increase. GST (CGST) receipts up to the end of February had grown 9.7% to₹3.4 trillion.

More than a fifth of super rich want to migrate out of India: Survey,https://www.livemint.com/economy/more-than-a-fifth-of-super-rich-want-to-migrate-out-of-india-survey-11742987372819.html,"Mumbai, Mar 26 (PTI) At least 22 per cent super rich Indians wish to leave the country due to factors like living conditions here, better standard of life abroad and also easier business environment in other countries, a survey said on Tuesday.
The survey of 150 ultra high networth individuals said that the US, UK, Australia, Canada and even UAE due to its golden visa scheme are the favourite destinations where the rich prefer to settle down.
Kotak Private, a leading wealth manager in the country which undertook the survey in association with consultancy EY, said 25 lakh Indians migrate to other countries every year as per the foreign ministry.
""One in five ultra HNIs surveyed are currently in the process of or plan to migrate,"" the survey findings said, adding most of them intend to reside in their host country of choice permanently while retaining their Indian citizenship.
They seek improved standard of living, healthcare solutions, education or lifestyle, the survey said, adding that over two-thirds said smoothening of business operations is a key driver for them.
Calling the migration decision as an ""investment in the future"", the survey also said that pursuit of excellent higher education for their children leads them to make the choice.
Kotak Mahindra Bank's president Gautami Gavankar, however, said the decision to migrate should not be seen as a flight of capital out of the country, pointing out that the caps on such activities ensure that the money does not flow out even if a person changes residency.
She said an Indian citizen residing in India can only take out USD 250,000 per year, while a non-resident is allowed USD 1 million, which ensures that there is no flight of capital.
The survey said the professionals show a higher propensity to migrate than the entrepreneurs or inheritors, while from an age group perspective, it is UHINs in the 36-40 years and above 61 years who are more keen to migrate.
There were 2.83 lakh Indians who can be tagged as UHNIs in 2023, with each having a net worth of over₹25 crore and their aggregate wealth was pegged at₹2.83 lakh crore. The same is expected to grow to 4.3 lakh individuals possessing a wealth of₹359 lakh crore by 2028, as per the survey.
Factors like higher consumption, the demographics, and strong economic growth will help in the growth of this segment, the survey said.
From a spending perspective, health and wellness has emerged as a key area especially after the pandemic, it said, adding that 81 per cent have reported an increase in their spends under the category.

Jobless Claims by US Federal Workers Remain High for Third Week,https://www.livemint.com/economy/jobless-claims-by-us-federal-workers-remain-high-for-third-week-11741900098785.html,"Applications for unemployment benefits filed by federal employees remained at an elevated level as the Trump administration continued to terminate workers across US agencies.
There were 1,066 initial claims filed nationwide in the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program for the week ended March 8, down from 1,580 the previous week, according to data posted Thursday on the Department of Labor’s website. The data is subject to revision before it’s reported in the March 20 weekly jobless claims report.
The number of continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, filed by federal workers for the week ended March 1 was 8,648, up from 8,215 the week prior.
Tens of thousands of federal jobs have been cut since President Donald Trump took office and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, started firing government workers across US agencies. The terminations are continuing, with the administration announcing on Tuesday it plans to cut half of the more than 4,000 employees at the Department of Education.
California had the most claims filed by federal workers last week at 146, followed by Maryland with 131, Washington, DC, with 110, Georgia with 109 and Virginia with 90, Thursday’s data showed.
Applications filed by out-of-work federal employees are reported separately from those of other workers. In data published earlier Thursday, overall applications for US unemployment benefits were little changed in the week ended March 8, decreasing by 2,000 to 220,000.

"Canada Ready for Talks on USMCA and China Dumping, Minister Says",https://www.livemint.com/economy/canada-ready-for-talks-on-usmca-and-china-dumping-minister-says-11741412788077.html,"Canada is ready to begin early talks on reviewing the North American free trade pact if the Trump administration wants to begin that process, Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said.
The government in Ottawa would prefer to move quickly to a broader negotiation that sorts out many points of trade friction, rather than talking “sector by sector, week by week,” LeBlanc said in an interview with Bloomberg News. The United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, which has been in place since 2020, is already scheduled for a joint review in 2026.
“If the American administration indicated to us that they wanted to advance that date and have those conversations, we would be ready,” LeBlanc said. There are, he said, “a lot of common interests between the three of us.”
And the finance minister said Canada is prepared to work with the White House hash out further measures to prevent China from “dumping into the North American market.” Canada put tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, steel and aluminum last year, largely to align with US trade policy. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday her country would review tariffs on Chinese shipments.
The minister’s comments came at the end of an unprecedented week of turbulence in trade relations across the North American trade bloc. The US imposed 25% tariffs on most goods it imports from Canada and Mexico — prompting swift retaliation from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, which put its own tariffs on about C$30 billion of US-made goods.
Trump offered a brief reprieve on Thursday, delaying US tariffs for goods covered under the USMCA until April 2. But tensions remain high and Trudeau said plainly this week that he believes Trump’s ultimate goal is to force economic hardship in Canada and annex the country.
Trump then fanned the flames on Friday, saying that “Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products” and threatening another round of tariffs.
Trudeau is about to leave office and his successor will be chosen by members of the governing Liberal Party on Sunday.
LeBlanc — who has endorsed former central banker Mark Carney in the Liberal contest — said he hadn’t had a “substantive conversation” yet on Friday with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or other officials about Trump’s comments on lumber and dairy.
Overall, “my conversations with Secretary Lutnick have been constructive, have frankly been cordial. They’re businesslike,” LeBlanc said.
There’s another trade-war deadline looming next week, as Trump has said the US will put 25% levies on foreign steel and aluminum on national security grounds. LeBlanc said he’s “not yet that pessimistic that they’re going to be imposed. My discussions with Secretary Lutnick are that there’s room to have conversations over the next few days.”

China State Banks Plan $72 Billion Placements to Add Capital,https://www.livemint.com/economy/china-state-banks-plan-72-billion-placements-to-add-capital-11743377507795.html,"Four of China’s largest state banks plan a total of up to $72 billion in private placements to boost core tier-1 capital, after Beijing pushed for stronger buffers for lenders to better support the economy.
Bank of Communications Co. will sell up to 120 billion yuan of A shares in a private placement to investors including the Ministry of Finance, according to a Sunday filing. Bank of China Ltd., Postal Savings Bank of China Ltd. and China Construction Bank Corp. plan placements of 165 billion yuan, 130 billion yuan and 105 billion yuan worth of A shares respectively to the finance ministry and other investors, according to separate filings.
China’s finance ministry will either take up the majority of the shares to be placed or subscribe to all of them, according to the filings. The shares will be sold at a premium between 8.8% and 21.5% above their Friday closing levels in Shanghai.
The announcements follow Chinese authorities’ pledge in early March to issue 500 billion yuan in special sovereign bonds to replenish capital at the nation’s biggest state-owned banks. The plan to help out the lenders was first flagged as far back as September and the government later said it would tap the notes to fund the injections.
China is beefing up the strength of its banking system — even though the top six lenders have capital levels that exceed requirements — after enacting a string of stimulus policies including cuts to mortgage and policy rates.
Enlisted to support the economy over the past few years, the lenders are battling record-low margins, slowing profit growth and rising bad debt. The sector’s net interest margin — a gauge of profitability — had slipped to 1.52% at end-2024, the lowest ever.
Stronger capital buffers will allow lenders to potentially provide more loans as Beijing vowed greater support for sectors from property to consumer and technology to achieve a growth target of about 5% this year. It’ll also serve China’s purpose to maintain financial stability and keep risks in check, while it contends with both domestic woes and tariff shocks from the US.

Achieving 70% female workforce participation by 2047 crucial for Viksit Bharat:  Labour Secy Sumita Dawra,https://www.livemint.com/economy/achieving-70-female-workforce-participation-by-2047-crucial-for-viksit-bharat-labour-secy-sumita-dawra-11741169646887.html,"New Delhi [India], March 5 (ANI): Achieving 70 per cent female workforce participation by 2047 is crucial for building a Viksit Bharat, as it can unlock significant economic potential and drive national growth, said Sumita Dawra, Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, on Wednesday in New Delhi.
Speaking at an event organized by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Sumita Dawra, Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment highlighted the significant strides made by women in India's economic landscape.
She noted that over the past six years, the labour force participation rate for women has risen from 23 per cent in 2017-18 to approximately 42 per cent in 2023-24, adding that the uptick is evident across various sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing and services, with a notable increase in educated women joining the workforce.
She acknowledges ongoing challenges such as workplace biases, wage disparities, limited leadership opportunities, job security concerns and the balancing act between professional and domestic responsibilities.
Dawra emphasised the importance of mentorship programs to prepare women for leadership roles and the need to create safe, inclusive workplaces.
She underscored the potential of sectors like STEM, entrepreneurship and startups for women's further involvement.
She reiterated the government's commitment to achieving the goal set in the Union Budget 2025-26, aiming for 70 per cent of women to be engaged in economic activities by 2047, aligning with the vision of a developed India.
Tarana Sawhney, Advisor, CII Task Force on Art & Culture emphasised the pivotal role of women in shaping India's cultural landscape.
She highlighted that historically, women have been the unseen architects of our cultural fabric--storytellers, artisans, performers, designers and curators--whose contributions are now gaining rightful recognition.
She added that notable figures such as Amrita Sher-Gil, whose works continue to achieve record sales, and contemporary artists like Mrinalini Mukherjee, Zarina Hashmi, and Nalini Malani have made significant international impacts, with exhibitions at prestigious venues including the Yorkshire Sculpture Park and the National Gallery in London.
Rina Dhaka, Indian Fashion Designer emphasised the pivotal role women play in the fashion industry, contributing significantly across design, production, retail and entrepreneurship.
Dhaka advocated for the establishment of skill building initiatives and training programs for female tailors, machine operators and CAD designers to enhance employment opportunities and promote fair compensation.
She urged for government and industry collaboration to provide mentorship, tailored policies and financial support, especially for small-scale, women-led businesses. (ANI)

"US tariff will open avenues for India to focus on self-reliance, boost local production: Report",https://www.livemint.com/economy/us-tariff-open-india-focus-self-reliance-boost-local-production-motilal-oswal-report-donald-trump-economy-trade-war-news-11742789896533.html,"Amid concerns over US PresidentDonald Trump's tariff policies, a report by Motilal Oswal suggests that India has the opportunity to strengthen its domestic industries.
The report mentioned that while the tariffs pose challenges such as rising costs, exchange rate fluctuations, and potential losses in exports, they also open avenues for India to focus on self-reliance and boost local production.
""While concerns persist regarding escalating costs, exchange rate volatility, and potential ramifications forexports, India can capitalize on trade tensions and fortify its domestic industries,"" the report said.
The US has imposed heavytariffson Indian exports in recent years. In 2018, tariffs of 25 per cent were levied on USD 761 million worth of steel and 10 per cent on USD 382 million worth of aluminum imported from India.
These higher costs made Indian products less competitive in the US market, leading to a 46 per cent decline in steel exports within a year. With American buyers opting for cheaper alternatives, Indian businesses suffered losses.
Another key concern for India is the impact of trade tensions on its currency. The report added that India imports 87 per cent of its crude oil, paying in U.S. dollars.
A weaker rupee due to capital outflows triggered by global trade disputes would make oil imports costlier, putting pressure on India's economy. A prolonged tariff war could shrinkIndia's GDPby 0.3 per cent, the report warns.
Despite these challenges, India can turn this situation into an opportunity. Historically, India has maintained higher tariff rates than other major economies. By strategically using import duties and strengthening domestic industries, India can reduce its dependence on foreign goods.
The report highlighted that thetrade conflictshould push India towards manufacturing self-sufficiency and boosting exports in sectors less affected by tariffs.
Trump's policies aim to balance protectionism with maintaining U.S. competitiveness in the globalmarket. While this creates uncertainty, as per report India can use the situation to its advantage by promoting domestic production, encouraging local investments, and improving trade agreements with other nations.

Trump’s Trade Salvos Test Nerves of Central Bankers,https://www.livemint.com/economy/trumps-trade-salvos-test-nerves-of-central-bankers-11742069930075.html,"An anxious sense of wait-and-see may emerge from central banks in the coming week, in their first collective assessment of how President Donald Trump’s trade policies are impacting the world economy.
While officials from Washington to London and Tokyo have already set borrowing costs once since the US president entered the White House in January, those decisions preceded a marked escalation in his rhetoric and measures against neighbors, allies and competitors alike.
With global tariffs now in place on steel and aluminum, and with Canada, China and the European Union all further suffering Trump’s ire, what were unrealized threats a few weeks ago have now emerged as full-blown hindrances to commerce.
Central bankers struggling to gauge whether the impact will be greater on growth or inflation may well choose to do nothing for now.
New-found worries about a potential US recession that gripped Wall Street in the past week probably won’t spur the Federal Reserve to deliver more easing for now, and unchanged interest rates are also the most likely outcomes at meetings in Japan, the UK and Sweden. Officials in South Africa, Russia and Indonesia may follow suit.
Some others will probably act immediately, though, against pressing risks — while warily assessing the shockwaves of Trump’s actions. In Brazil, for example, the central bank is widely anticipated to raise borrowing costs again to fight resurgent inflation.
What Bloomberg Economics Says:
“Even as consumer and business confidence deteriorate quickly, the Fed’s degree of freedom to cut rates is constrained by indicators showing a surge in inflation expectations. In the absence of a ‘Trump Put,’ the Fed’s reluctance to cut – to offer the market a ‘Fed Put’ at least – could push the downturn in sentiment into something beyond just vibes.”
—Anna Wong and Chris G. Collins, economists. For full analysis, click here
In all, officials responsible for half of the world’s 10 most-traded currencies, along with other Group of 20 peers, are poised to set rates over the coming days.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Wednesday described the challenge confronted by many of global counterparts. With her own institution recently having stopped short of signaling its next move out of caution about the backdrop, she says the job of monetary policymaking just got harder.
“The level of uncertainty we are facing is exceptionally high,” Lagarde said. “Maintaining stability in a new era will be a formidable task.”
Click here for what happened in the past week, and below is a closer look at the panoply of central-bank decisions due in the coming days.
US
With Fed officials expected to hold rates steady on Wednesday at the conclusion of their two-day meeting, the market will focus on officials’ updated economic projections and Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference for clues about the path ahead.
Economists expect officials to lower borrowing costs twice this year, starting in September, according to a Bloomberg survey. For now, policymakers have signaled they’re in a wait-and-see mode as they seek further progress on inflation and greater clarity on the economic impact of Trump’s policies.
Powell emphasized this month that the Fed doesn’t need to be in a hurry to cut rates. But amid a recent selloff in stocks paired with mounting growth concerns and souring consumer sentiment, the Fed chief will likely be pressed on whether the central bank will be ready to step in should the economy turn south.
Asia
Japan
The Bank of Japan is widely expected to hold rates steady on Wednesday as authorities assess the impact of their January hike, with the focus falling on whether persistent yen weakness, high inflation and robust wage gains may open the door to a hike on May 1.
About half of surveyed economists say such an increase won’t come until July, though.
Indonesia
Indonesia’s central bank on Wednesday may continue to pause its easing cycle. Monetary authorities are aiming to limit capital outflows after the rupiah faced renewed pressure following the decision to keep rates on hold in February.
China
A day later, lenders in China, with guidance from the central bank, are expected to hold the 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates steady. That will follow data earlier in the week likely to have been distorted by the Lunar New Year holiday, with economists anticipating a 5% year-on-year increase in industrial production, a moderated decline in property investment, and increases in both retail sales and fixed asset investment.
Taiwan
Taiwan’s central bank decision is also due on Thursday, and officials in Taipei are expected to keep the benchmark rate at 2% for a fourth straight meeting.
Europe, Middle East, Africa
UK
The Bank of England is set to hold fire on another cut on Thursday. That would leave its rate at 4.5% as it sticks to a gradual, once-a-quarter pace for reductions.
While the latest growth data showed a surprise contraction, the BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee is likely to prime investors for a cautious approach to further easing in the face of mounting geopolitical tensions, stubborn price pressures, and uncertainty over the impact of the Labour government’s first budget.
Dissenting policymakers may back an immediate rate cut, but other officials on the panel with a dovish leaning have signaled increasing hesitancy in recent weeks.
Switzerland
In contrast with its advanced-economy peers, the Swiss National Bank’s decision on Thursday is laden with suspense.
Many forecasters anticipate a final quarter-point reduction, to 0.25%, to cushion growth from a global backdrop of likely Trump-induced economic weakness.
But with less pressure on the franc for now, the need to preserve precious ammunition for future easing as a shield against currency inflows could persuade officials to keep borrowing costs unchanged.
Sweden
The Riksbank is set to hold its rate at 2.25% after five consecutive cuts. Officials have signaled a preference to gauge the lagged impact of those steps on a tepid economy, and faster-than-expected inflation may have further cemented that view.
Other data have been contradictory. Sweden’s gross domestic product rose the most in 2 1/2 years during the fourth quarter, but survey indicators point to weakness.
Analysts have increasingly dropped predictions for one more quarter-point move this easing cycle, while overnight swaps now price in only three basis points of cuts by the August meeting, down from 38 basis points seen at the end of last month.
South Africa
After three successive hikes, South African policymakers may keep their rate at 7.5% on Thursday as they weigh the impact of global tariffs on their inflation forecasts. Neighboring Eswatini, whose currency is pegged to the rand, may also hold the following day.
Russia
With inflation having risen above 10% in February, the Bank of Russia will assess the need on Friday for another hike in its rate, which has been at a record high 21% since October. Bloomberg Economics expects policymakers to opt for a third consecutive hold.
Angola
The central bank will likely leave its key rate unchanged at 19.5% for a fifth meeting in a row on Tuesday as officials try to curb high inflation.
Morocco
Policymakers cut the base rate by 25 basis points to 2.5% in December. Since then, inflation has accelerated from under 1% to about 2%, which may cause them to hold off easing again on Tuesday.
Iceland
The central bank in Reykjavik may slow the rate of easing at its second decision of the year on Wednesday. Local lenders Landsbankinn hf and Islandbanki hf both predict a quarter-point reduction, to 7.75%.
Latin America
Brazil
Banco Central do Brasil’s March meeting on Wednesday will be missing some of its usual drama, as policymakers have telegraphed they’ve lined up a third straight 100 basis-point rate hike, to 14.25%. Analysts and traders expect it to end 2025 at 15%.
Chile
Sticky and stubbornly elevated inflation, risks skewed to the upside, and wobbles in expectations persuaded Chile’s central bank to keep its 5% rate unchanged in January.
A slight slowdown in February consumer prices data, putting the annual rate at 4.8%, likely headed off a hike for this Friday, but strong domestic demand argues against any easing. In fact, traders are expecting no change in policy for the next 12 months, while local analysts see room for 50 basis points in cuts.
Argentina
Since President Javier Milei took office in December 2023, the Argentine central bank’s rate moves have often come in close proximity to monthly inflation reports.
After February data’s released on Friday, Argentina watchers are on alert for the bank’s 10th rate cut under Milei. It’s one of the more unorthodox elements of the president’s strategy to slow inflation in South America’s No. 2 economy.
Paraguay
Paraguay’s central bank has kept borrowing costs unchanged at 6% since delivering a quarter-point cut a year ago, but February’s jump in headline inflation to 4.3% may bolster the hawkish case at this week’s policy meeting.

"India’s forex reserves soar USD 15.3 billion, highest weekly jump in over 3 years",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-forex-reserves-soar-usd-15-3-billion-highest-weekly-jump-in-over-3-years-11742112496237.html,"New Delhi [India], March 16 (ANI): India's foreign exchange reserves had their highest weekly gains in over three years in the week ending March 7.
Reserve Bank of India data showed that in the week under consideration, foreign exchange reserves rose by USD 15.267 billion to USD 653.966 billion.
Forex reserves had slumped for about four months, recently hitting an 11-month low. Then followed the latest rollercoaster movement, with gains some weeks and declines the next.
Forex reserves started falling after touching an all-time high of USD 704.89 billion in September. They are now about 7 percent lower from their peak.
The decline in reserves is most likely due to RBI intervention, aimed at preventing a sharp depreciation of the Rupee. The Indian Rupee is now at or near its all-time low against the US dollar.
The latest RBI data showed that India's foreign currency assets (FCA), the largest component of forex reserves, stood at USD 557.282 billion.
Gold reserves currently amount to USD 74.325 billion, according to RBI data.
Estimates suggest that India's foreign exchange reserves are sufficient to cover approximately 10-11 months of projected imports.
In 2023, India added around USD 58 billion to its foreign exchange reserves, contrasting with a cumulative decline of USD 71 billion in 2022. In 2024, the reserves rose by a little over USD 20 billion.
Foreign exchange reserves, or FX reserves, are assets held by a nation's central bank or monetary authority, primarily in reserve currencies such as the US Dollar, with smaller portions in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling.
The RBI often intervenes by managing liquidity, including selling dollars, to prevent steep Rupee depreciation. The RBI strategically buys dollars when the Rupee is strong and sells when it weakens. (ANI)

Charting the Global Economy: Tariffs Fuel US Inflation Concerns,https://www.livemint.com/economy/charting-the-global-economy-tariffs-fuel-us-inflation-concerns-11742030960087.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Anxiety is building quickly among US consumers about the likely impact from US tariffs on the economy and their pocketbooks.
A preliminary March survey of consumers showed sentiment sank by more than projected, while long-term inflation expectations jumped as the Trump administration pushes forward with higher duties on foreign goods just as price pressures showed signs of easing.
Meanwhile, the UK economy shrank unexpectedly at the start of the year on weaker manufacturing and construction. In China, the economy remains hamstrung by persistent deflation.
Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy, markets and geopolitics:
US
Consumer sentiment fell to a more than two-year low and long-term inflation expectations jumped by the most since 1993, illustrating growing apprehension about the economic impact from tariffs. Consumers’ expectations of their finances dropped to the lowest level on record, the University of Michigan survey showed.
US consumer prices rose at the slowest pace in four months in February, welcome news for American households who remain apprehensive about the potential for tariffs to drive costs higher. Economists anticipate that an escalating trade war will drive up prices on a variety of goods from food to clothing in the coming months, testing the resilience of consumers and the broader economy.
President Donald Trump dialed back his latest trade-war threat against Canada hours after making it, while downplaying the risk of a tariff-led recession that’s sent US markets into a nosedive.
Europe
Germany is experiencing its deepest identity crisis since World War II. Years of play-it-safe politics have allowed its roads and bridges to fall into disrepair, its digital transition to sputter and productivity to flag. With the political center shrinking, Germany may be condemned to a series of ineffectual governments that, like Olaf Scholz’s fractious coalition, lack the unity and will to tackle the country’s complex problems, from soaring state pension costs to declining student achievement. Unless Germany can find a way out soon, the result could destabilize all of Europe.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves blamed the turbulence of global politics for a surprise contraction in the UK economy, as she prepares to reveal a belt-tightening fiscal update later this month. January’s fall in output was driven by declines in manufacturing and construction with the strongest UK storm for 10 years cited as a drag on certain sectors.
Asia
China’s intensifying deflationary pressure threatens to persist long after seasonal distortions fade away, unless the government drains excess capacity in the economy that’s putting pressure on prices. Consumer inflation in the year to date has turned negative through January-February for the first time since 2021.
India’s inflation eased to below the central bank’s target last month, giving policymakers reason to keep cutting interest rates as the economy faces new headwinds from global trade turmoil.
Japan’s workers saw their base pay rise at the fastest clip in 32 years, a result that sends a positive signal to the Bank of Japan as it weighs the prospects for demand-driven economic growth.

Brazil’s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has weathered financial crises, corruption scandals and even a coup attempt. But now it’s the soaring cost of food that’s posing the biggest hazard for his presidency.

An ocean freighter from India pulled into the bustling Port of Tampa Bay on Tuesday loaded with hundreds of tons of aluminum destined for multiple US stops. Abruptly, the entire shipment was ordered to be unloaded then and there with US tariffs set to commence the next day. This is the kind of disruption that has been replicated across the country as Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs played out.
The Bank of Canada cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point and called the trade battle with the US a “new crisis,” but pushed back on expectations that policymakers were on a predetermined cutting path. Pakistan unexpectedly kept rates steady, while Poland, Georgia and Serbia, Peru also left rates unchanged.

"Housing sales drop 23%, supply falls 34% in top 9 cities in Q1 2025: PropEquity",https://www.livemint.com/economy/housing-sales-drop-23-supply-falls-34-in-top-9-cities-in-q1-2025-propequity-11742718515960.html,"New Delhi [India], March 23 (ANI): The housing market continued its downward trend with housing sales in India's top nine cities falling by 23 per cent while supply declined by a whopping 34 per cent in Jan-March of 2025, said a report by data analytics firm PropEquity.
Housing sales in Q1 2025 stood at 1,05,791 units as compared to 1,36,702 units in the same period last year. Except in Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR, all seven cities witnessed a decline in sales.
Housing supply, on the other hand, stood at 80,774 units in Q1 2025 as compared to 1,22,365 units in the same period last year, marking three consecutive quarters of under-1 lakh units launched. Except in Bengaluru, all eight cities saw a decline in new supply in the first quarter.
Samir Jasuja, Founder & CEO, PropEquity said, ""The housing market is witnessing some correction after three years (2021, 2022, 2023) of record supply because of which absorption/sales is also on a declining trend. The rise in home prices and caution on the part of investors due to geo-political developments and certain weaknesses in the Indian economy have resulted in a drop in sales. However, the market has displayed strong demand as is evident from the healthy absorption to supply ratio, which stood at 131 per cent in Q1 2025, 132 per cent in Q4 2024 and 127 per cent in Q3 2024.""
He said that traditionally high-supply markets - Hyderabad, Pune and Thane - continue to decline. These cities had the highest supply among all tier-1 cities for two years running 2022 and 2023, before touching a low in 2024.
""In this quarter, they cumulatively saw 28,227 units of lesser supply as compared to the same period last year. In fact, the share of the three cities to the total launches has come down from to 29 per cent in Q1 2025 as compared to 3 per cent in the same period last year,"" he added.
Housing supply rose by 17 per cent in Bengaluru to 20,227 units in Q1 2025. The city accounted for 25 per cent of the total launches in Q1 2025, rising from 14 per cent in the same period last year.
It fell the most in Kolkata at 62 per cent followed by 50 per cent each in Mumbai and Thane, 48 per cent in Pune, 46 per cent in Chennai, 38 per cent in Hyderabad, 24 per cent in Navi Mumbai and 14 per cent in Delhi-NCR. (ANI)

"India’s industrial production growth likely at 3.7% in Jan, surge from 3.2 % in Dec 24: Union Bank of India",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-industrial-production-growth-likely-at-3-7-in-jan-surge-from-3-2-in-dec-24-union-bank-of-india-11741406365957.html,"New Delhi [India], : India's industrial production, measured by the Index of Industrial Production , is likely to surge to 3.7 per cent year-on-year in January 2025, up from 3.2 per cent in December 2024, according to a report by Union Bank of India.
The report attributed this improvement to an overall rise in industrial activity. However, the report also highlights that despite this monthly increase, the IIP growth in January is likely to be lower compared to 4.2 per cent recorded in January 2024, indicating a year-on-year decline.
It said ""Industrial production growth, as indicated by IIP, likely inch-up to 3.7 pc YoY in Jan'25, from 3.2 pc in previous month and 4.2 pc in Jan'24, due to improvement in overall industrial activities"".
The report suggested that high-frequency indicators for January 2025 showed broad-based optimism across various sectors. Although India's merchandise exports contracted by 2.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis in January, merchandise imports grew by 10.3 per cent, signaling robust domestic demand.
Other economic indicators also pointed towards positive momentum in industrial activities. E-way bill generation, which reflects the movement of goods across states, rose significantly by 23.1 per cent in January compared to the same period last year.
Additionally, toll collections showed strong growth in both volume and value terms, indicating increased transportation and economic activity.
India's automobile sector witnessed a recovery in January, reversing the contraction seen in the previous two months. Wholesale automobile sales grew by 2.5 per cent year-on-year, supported by a rebound in the two-wheeler segment. Tractor sales recorded double-digit growth for the second consecutive month, while vehicle registrations also expanded during the month.
Petroleum consumption, another indicator of industrial and economic activity, increased by 3.1 per cent in January compared to the same month last year.
This growth reflects higher demand for fuel, which could be linked to increased transportation, manufacturing, and overall industrial expansion.
Overall, the report suggested that while industrial production in January 2025 is expected to improve compared to the previous month, the growth rate remains lower than the same period last year. The positive performance of key economic indicators, however, hints at strengthening industrial momentum in the coming months.

This tax hike has resulted in a₹2 per litre increase in diesel prices, pushing the retail price to₹91.02 per litre across the state. From Tuesday, Diesel will cost₹91.02 per litre in Bengaluru as well.
Currently,dieselis priced at₹88.99 per litre, while petrol costs₹102.92 per litre in the state.
The lasthike in diesel priceswas seen last year, in June 2024, when the government had increased Sales Tax on petrol from 25.92 percent to 29.84 percent and on diesel from 14.3 percent to 18.4 percent, which led to an increase in the prices of petrol and diesel per litre by₹3 and₹3.02 respectively.

The Siddaramaiah-led government in Karnataka is facing mounting criticism over a series of price hikes affecting various sectors. The latest addition to this list is the introduction of a user fee for solid waste management, which the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will begin collecting alongside property tax from households this month.
This new charge comes on the heels of several other recent increases that have put pressure on residents' wallets. Public transport users have been particularly affected, with bus fares rising by 15% and Metro fares seeing a dramatic increase of up to 71%. Essential commodities have not been spared either, as evidenced by a₹4 per litre hike in milk prices.
The energy sector has also seen significant changes, with power tariffs set to climb over the next few years. Fixed charges are slated to increase by₹25 in 2025-26, followed by further rises of₹30 in 2026-27 and₹40 in 2027-28, according to aMoneycontrolreport.
Additional Chief Secretary LK Atheeq defended the decision to hikediesel prices, stating that even after the hike, diesel prices in Karnataka remain among the lowest in South India.
The Karnataka Government shared the following table to assert their statement
“The Karnataka Sales Tax rate on diesel was at 24% prior to 04-11-2021, and the sale price per litre was 92.03. On 15-06-2024, the Karnataka State Government issued a notification revising the tax rate on diesel to 18.44%”, the official statement read.

"Trump Floats More Tariffs on EU, Canada If They Work Against US",https://www.livemint.com/economy/trump-floats-more-tariffs-on-eu-canada-if-they-work-against-us-11743090394629.html,"Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. .
President Donald Trump suggested further tariffs would be imposed on the European Union and Canada if they worked together “to do economic harm” to the US.
In a late night Truth Social post, Trump said large-scale tariffs “far larger than currently planned” would be placed on them in such a scenario. The euro briefly pared a small gain and the Canadian dollar dipped.
“If the European Union works with Canada in order to do economic harm to the USA, large scale Tariffs, far larger than currently planned, will be placed on them both in order to protect the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had!” Trump posted.
Listen to the Bloomberg Daybreak Europe podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.
Trump signed an order on Wednesday imposing a 25% tariff on auto imports, escalating a trade war designed to bring more manufacturing jobs to the US. The move sets the stage for more tariff actions next week, including promised so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2, potentially deepening tensions with key trading partners. Other industry-specific tariffs are also in the works, including on lumber, semiconductors and pharmaceutical drugs.
The EU is preparing countermeasures in response. France has urged the European Commission to consider using its toughest trade weapon — the anti-coercion instrument – for the first time, Bloomberg reported earlier.
Trump’s latest comments come after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited France and the UK last week on his first foreign trip to pitch a closer alliance with European allies.
“I want to ensure that France and the whole of Europe works enthusiastically with Canada, the most European of non-European countries,” Carney said in Paris.

German Minister Says Trump Tariffs Mustn’t Weaken EU Green Goals,https://www.livemint.com/economy/german-minister-says-trump-tariffs-mustn-t-weaken-eu-green-goals-11743092718349.html,"The European Union must resist pressure to weaken climate targets in order to aid carmakers after US President Donald Trump said he would slap a 25% tariff on auto imports, Germany’s outgoing environment minister said.
“It is clear that the announcement by the United States government should not be used to call into question any goals that we have agreed upon in the EU,” Steffi Lemke, a minister for the Green party, said on the sidelines of a meeting in Brussels. “A race toward lowering environmental standards globally will not benefit anyone.”
The EU’s current targets stipulate that all cars sold in the region’s single market should be emissions-free by 2035, but a slowdown in EV sales has buttressed lobbying for more flexibility and even a delay. The commission has brought forward a review of the regulations to this year and it’s not yet clear what stance Germany’s new government will take.
Her comments underscore a debate that is likely to turn sour over the next few months: how far the EU should go in reviewing its climate targets for the auto sector.
The conservative party of Friedrich Merz, Germany’s Chancellor-in-waiting, has called for changes to the rules that would allow combustion engine vehicles to still be sold after 2035. The Green party will not be a part of the next governing coalition.
The car industry has already managed to secure additional flexibility on interim emissions-cutting goals that were originally set for 2025 so that they will not face fines this year on top of an already challenging economic backdrop.
Lemke said that Trump’s tariffs on the auto sector, which will kick in before the planned review of the 2035 goal, shouldn’t be used as an excuse to water down the headline targets, even if some additional flexibility may be needed. Germany was still studying the impact of the tariffs on its auto sector and the EU should be careful in its response, she added.
“A unified European reaction to the announcement of US President Donald Trump is necessary,” Lemke said. “But it shouldn’t be done in a rushed way.”

EU delays retaliatory trade action to mid-April to work out the impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs,https://www.livemint.com/economy/eu-delays-retaliatory-trade-action-to-mid-april-to-work-out-the-impact-of-trump-s-reciprocal-tariffs-11742513951061.html,"BRUSSELS — The European Union is delaying until mid-April its retaliatory trade action over the Trump administration’s increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, senior officials said Thursday.
The EU had intended to impose measures on goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros in two phases, on April 1 and April 13. The tariffs will target steel and aluminum products, but also American beef, poultry, bourbon, motorcycles, peanut butter and jeans.
But U.S. President Donald Trump also plans to impose “reciprocal” tariffs by increasing U.S. duties to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports “for purposes of fairness.” These reciprocal tariffs are expected to be announced on April 2.
“I can confirm that we decided to adjust the timing of the entry into force of tariffs,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. The EU’s executive branch manages trade negotiations and disputes on behalf of the 27-member bloc.
Von der Leyen said that with the delay, the commission’s goal is “to get the balance of products right, reflecting the interests of our producers, our exporters, our consumers, and of course, minimize the potential negative impact on our economy.”
EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, who has held talks with U.S. officials to try to avoid a tariff war, warned lawmakers earlier on Thursday that “the situation is quite fluid, quite volatile.”
Šefčovič said that delaying the measures would allow the EU to better understand the possible impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs and work out how best to respond.
“This would also give us extra time for negotiations with our American partners to try to find a mutually agreeable solution, which clearly would be a preference for us,” he added.
Von der Leyen reaffirmed that the world’s biggest trading bloc is “opposed to tariffs. We think that tariffs are bad. They are like taxes. They are bad for consumers. They are bad for business on both sides of the Atlantic without any question.”

Trump also criticised the trade surplus under former President Joe Biden and vowed to reverse it quickly.
On a Truth Social post, Trump wrote, ""We have massive financial deficits with China, the European Union, and many others.

Earlier in the day, Trump told reporters he would not make a deal unless the trade deficit is solved.
“We have to solve our trade deficit,” particularly with China, Trump said. He said he wouldn’t make a deal unless it drives down the US trade deficit in goods withChina. “I want that solved,” he said.
He further added that he is touch with European and Asian leaders on the tariffs rolled out by his administration
On April 2, Trump announced that the US would placetariffson many countries around the world. In February, shortly after starting his second term, he introduced a new trade policy based on fairness and reciprocity. He said the US would match the tariffs that other countries place on American goods.
As per the announcements, the import tariffs on other major countries are China (34 per cent), the European Union (20 per cent), Vietnam (46 per cent), Taiwan (32 per cent), Japan (24 per cent), India (26 per cent), the United Kingdom (10 per cent), Bangladesh (37 per cent), Pakistan (29 per cent), Sri Lanka (44 per cent), and Israel (17 per cent).
From April 9 onwards, countries with the largest trade deficits with the US will face higher, individualised tariffs. India is one of the countries affected, with a 26 per cent tariff imposed on all its exports.

Japan’s Finance Minister Says Higher Yields Aren’t All Bad,https://www.livemint.com/economy/japans-finance-minister-says-higher-yields-aren-t-all-bad-11741669765938.html,"Japan’s rising bond yields will have both positive and negative effects on the economy, the nation’s finance minister said Tuesday in a comment likely aimed at easing recent market concern over higher borrowing costs.
While the yield on 10-year government debt fell Tuesday amid global market concerns over the economic outlook, that move came after it hit a 17-year high of 1.575% on Monday.
“Higher yields will impact the economy in multiple ways,” Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters. While interest payments will rise for issuers, interest received will increase for buyers, he added.
Kato was likely trying to play down recent concerns over the upward trajectory of yields. His remarks indicate that the government isn’t only looking at rising yields with concern over the implications for how they might ramp up debt-servicing costs or cool economic activity.
The finance minister spoke a day after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said that the government “will ensure thorough preparations” to guard against a sharp rise in long-term yields. Ishiba’s comment suggested heightened government concern over the recent gains.
The implications of higher interest rates are particularly acute for Japan given its high debt load. The International Monetary Fund estimates the nation’s public debt at around 233% of gross domestic product this year. Servicing Japan’s oversized debt is already expected to chew up close to a quarter of the annual budget for the year starting in April.
For many years the BOJ manipulated long-term bond yields to keep them around zero as part of its efforts to generate an inflation cycle that sparks stronger growth. Last year the central bank scrapped its control of yields and committed itself to paring back its purchases, thereby removing a ceiling on yields and allowing the market to determine pricing.
The BOJ still says it will step in if there are sharp moves in yields, but it remains unclear what scale of change would trigger action, creating uncertainty among traders of Japanese government bonds. While the central bank is legally independent from the government they are both committed to the achievement of sustained growth and stable inflation through a 2013 joint accord.
Core inflation in Japan is now approaching three years at or above the BOJ’s target. So after years of subzero interest rates, the direction of Japanese borrowing costs is on an upward path, even as central banks elsewhere in the world mull the timing of their next rate cuts.
Kato touched on the need to maintain steady demand for Japanese government debt to avoid sharp fluctuations in pricing in the wake of the BOJ’s stepping back in the market.
“As a bond-issuing authority, I think it’s important to aim for stable sales of government bonds,” he said.

World Facing Trump’s Tariffs Watches Canada Test Ways of Fighting Back,https://www.livemint.com/economy/world-facing-trump-s-tariffs-watches-canada-test-ways-of-fighting-back-11741742079594.html,"World leaders from New Delhi to Brussels facing tariffs from President Donald Trump’s administration are watching Canada to get a preview of what happens when you hit back.
Canadian officials have gone hostile in their responses to Trump’s trade war. Ontario Premier Doug Ford slapped a 25% charge on electricity exports to make power more expensive for people in New York and two other states — earning the president’s ire. Mark Carney, the incoming prime minister, called the US “a country we can no longer trust,” and said his new government will keep its retaliatory tariffs in place “until the Americans show us respect.”
On Tuesday, the brinkmanship seemed to pay off: Trump started the day threatening to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum to 50%, but by day’s end both sides had pulled back. Ford suspended the electricity tax, prompting Trump to say “I respect that” and drop the metals levy back to 25%.
Mélanie Joly, the foreign minister, has a simple message for other nations listening to Trump’s threats against Canada: “You’re next.”
But it wasn’t meant to get to this. For months, Joly, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other officials made a series of trips to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and then to the US capital in an unprecedented charm offensive that aimed to avert a tariff war and address border-security concerns from Trump and his team. It made little difference.
Trump imposed 25% tariffs on many Canadian products last week — citing drug-trafficking and the border as his reasons — and is now set to go ahead with broad levies on foreign steel and aluminum on Wednesday morning.
The mood in Canada has shifted over the past month as Trump and his officials followed through on tariff threats and continued to make taunts about turning Canada into the 51st US state. Public opinion in the nation of about 42 million has turned angry, with voters demanding politicians stand up to the US president.
Consider the case of Wab Kinew, the premier of Manitoba. When he and the other 12 provincial leaders visited Washington in mid-February, he brought a message of peace. “We’re here extending that warm and hearty handshake, we’re trying to make friends,” Kinew said at the time. “In grade school, we didn’t make friends by threatening to hit anybody.”
Last week, after Trump implemented the first round of tariffs against Canada, Kinew ordered the removal US-made alcohol from stores in the province. And then he openly mocked Trump — holding up a copy of his signature in the same way that Trump does when he signs executive orders in the White House, while members of his government clapped on cue.
British Columbia Premier David Eby has worked overtime to relay the nation’s frustration, and his own. “We’re going to ensure that the Americans understand how pissed off we are,” he said.
Other countries have played it cooler on the trade war, at least in public. Mexico has been subject to parallel White House complaints and threats of 25% tariffs, and also bolstered its border measures in a bid to placate Trump. But unlike Canada, it hasn’t yet announced counter-tariffs.
Trump cited “respect” for Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum as he exempted goods covered by the North American trade agreement from the new 25% levies. But he’s kept on insulting Trudeau, claiming he’s done a “terrible job” for Canada and listing ways he feels Canada is “cheating” the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal the three countries negotiated during Trump’s first term.
With Mexico spared the same level of US aggression as Canada, experts are divided on the best long-term tactic. The question is whether Canada has no choice but to embrace brinkmanship to secure a better deal, or whether the less-friendly approach just provokes Trump into inflicting more damage.
“I think what Claudia Sheinbaum has done has been a much better move. She’s been a much more diplomatic, serious leader,” said David Collins, a professor who specializes in international trade and investment law at City St. George’s, University of London.
For Canada, the only way to resolve the issue is to urgently renegotiate the USMCA trade deal, Collins said — a process that Trudeau delayed, he argued, when he announced his resignation on Jan. 6. and paused Parliament while his Liberal Party chose a successor.
Carney, the winner of that race, was asked in January by the BBC whether the UK can avoid becoming a Trump target if it just stays quiet. His reply: “Good luck with that.”
Kevin Milligan, an economics professor at the University of British Columbia, agrees and believes the proof is in what just happened with Ontario. The provincial government’s action to penalize US buyers of electricity brought the wrath of Trump, but it also pushed the situation to the top of the news agenda. Ford, the Ontario premier, is now scheduled to meet with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Thursday.
Trump “just showed us where he is weak,” Milligan said in an interview on Tuesday shortly before Ford and Lutnick announced the détente. “He’s very upset about electricity. Good. Then we’ve got to poke electricity even harder.”
Trump has said he will erect “reciprocal tariffs” in April — tariffs that are commensurate with what the administration says are trade barriers put up by other countries. That is likely to tee up disputes between the US and a wide array of trading partners.
“A good lesson to draw from Canada is building a sense of unity across those countries,” Milligan said. “They should push back, but push back in a united way, and that’s where you’re going to have the most chance for success.”
Joly, the foreign minister, has suggested that she wants to work with allies to try and coordinate a wider response to tariffs. Those other countries may be relieved they don’t face the patriotic fever gripping the US’s northern neighbor, where the issue isn’t just about trade but also Trump’s contention that the country should be an American state and that he’d use “economic force” to make that happen.
“It makes it very difficult to find those win-wins that you like to have, having raised the stakes like this,” said Milligan. “So we’re just going to push back as hard as we can.”

Trump tariffs: Why is the US President confident of Fed rate cuts despite Jerome Powell’s inflation warning?,https://www.livemint.com/economy/trump-tariffs-why-is-the-us-president-confident-of-fed-rate-cuts-despite-jerome-powells-inflation-warning-11743865357996.html,"Trump tariffs:US PresidentDonald Trump's new tariffs are ""larger than expected,"" and the economic fallout, including higher inflation and slower growth, likely will be,US Federal ReserveChairJerome Powellsaid while warning it was still too soon to know what the central bank's response ought to be.
On the other hand,Trump called for Powell to pursue interest rate cuts, citing lower energy prices, interest rates, and inflation, among other things. “This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates. He is always ‘late,’ but he could now change his image, and quickly,” Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social, a platform he owned.

Trump ordered Jerome Powell to cut interest rates, which currently range from 4.25 per cent to 4.50 per cent. “Energy prices are down, Interest Rates are down, Inflation is down, even Eggs are down 69 per cent, and Jobs are UP, all within two months - A BIG WIN for America. CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS,” Donald Trump wrote in the post.
The US President's comments come after he unveiled a series of tariffs on several nations, a move that economists believe would result in a global economic slowdown. Global financial markets, including the US stock market, have been spooked, shedding over five trillion in investors' wealth.

Powell spoke as equity markets from Tokyo to London to New York continued a swoon that has wiped some 10 per cent off major US stock indexes since Trump announced new tariffs on trading partners worldwide on Wednesday.
Investors had looked to Powell's speech for reassurance that perhaps the Fed was poised to take supportive actions as it has in previous moments of extreme market duress. However, Trump still took to his social media platform to say now would be the ""perfect time"" for the Fed to cut interest rates.
""We face a highly uncertain outlook now with elevated risks of a higher unemployment and higher inflation,"" Powell said at a business journalists conference in Arlington, Virginia, undermining the US Fed's mandates of two per cent inflation and maximum employment.

Powell did not address the selloff directly, instead acknowledging that the Fed faced the same uncertainty engulfing investors and executives. TheS&P 500 Index was down another nearly six per cent, with the Dow Jones Average 5.5 per cent lower and the Nasdaq off five per cent, ending a two-day decline that is the worst since the onset of the COVID pandemic in 2020.
""While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent,"" said Powell. ""We must keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,"" he said.
Jerome Powell said it was not the Fed's role to comment on Trump's policies but rather to react to how they might affect an economy that he and his colleagues regarded just a few weeks ago as a ""sweet spot"" of falling inflation and low unemployment.

Thailand Drafts Law to Speed Up $29 Billion Transport Link,https://www.livemint.com/economy/thailand-drafts-law-to-speed-up-29-billion-transport-link-11742635597813.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Thailand unveiled draft legislation to create a special economic zone in the south of the country that would pave the way for a multibillion-dollar transport project linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
The bill would establish a commission to speed up development of the Southern Economic Corridor in the provinces of Chumphon, Ranong, Suratthani and Nakhon Si Thammarat, according to a Transport Ministry statement.
Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s Pheu Thai party is proposing the so-called Landbridge project at a cost of about 1 trillion baht ($29 billion), to link two proposed seaports on either side of the country’s southern peninsula with a new highway and rail line. The 100-kilometer (62-mile) connection would cut shipping times between the Indian and Pacific oceans by bypassing the Malacca Strait — a narrow sea lane between Malaysia and Singapore that is one of the world’s busiest ocean routes.
The new commission, chaired by the prime minister, will be responsible for the development of logistics, infrastructure, information technology and other facilities in the specified areas, according to the draft bill. It will also be in charge of finding the money to fund the project.
The draft bill is being presented for public hearing before proceeding to the Cabinet and parliament.
Former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, also from the Pheu Thai party, previously pitched the Landbridge project to overseas investors during visits to the US and China.
Thailand aims to complete the project by 2030 and foreign investors will be allowed to own more than 50% of joint ventures with local companies to build the infrastructure. The deep sea ports in Ranong in the Andaman Sea and Chumphon in the Gulf of Thailand may cost 630 billion baht, according to the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning.

India’s core sector growth slows to 2.9% in February,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-core-sector-growth-in-february-industrial-production-growth-iip-manufacturing-growth-pmi-11743164843785.html,"The output of eight core infrastructure sectors, which account for two-fifths of India’s industrial output, expanded by 2.9% in February—the slowest monthly pace in five months.
A year ago, in February 2024, core sector output had expanded at 7.1%.
Only three of the eight core industries reported a monthly rise in production, and only two sectors, cement and fertilizers, saw higher output in February compared to the year-ago period, showed the latest core sector data released by the Union commerce ministry on Friday.
To be sure, core sector output contributes 40.27% to the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).
In January, industrial output growth picked up, after slowing down in the previous month, due to a rise in manufacturing and mining activities.
The IIP grew at 5% in January, up from 3.2% in the previous month, according to the estimates released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
""The core sector growth moderated to a five-month low of 2.9% in February 2025 from 5.1% in January 2025, although this was partly on account of the leap year-related high base,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist, head-research and outreach, Icra Ltd.
""As many as five of the eight indicators, including coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery and cement output, recorded a weaker annual performance in February 2025 vis-à-vis the previous month. Given these trends, we expect the IIP growth to ease to about 3-3.5% in February 2025 from 5.0% in January 2025,"" she added.
Fertilizers and cement boosted core sector output in February, with production growth of 10.2% and 10.5%, respectively, although cement production growth declined month-on-month.
Fertilizers and cement output grew by 3% and 14.6%, respectively, in January.
In February, the output of crude oil contracted by 5.2% and natural gas by 6%.
Coal output grew by 1.7% in February, its slowest pace in six months, while refinery output rose by 0.8%, also the slowest in six months.
Steel production grew by 5.6% in February, up from 4.7% in the previous month, while electricity output rose by 2.8%, compared to a 2.4% rise in January.
India’s manufacturing growth fell in February after rising to a six-month high in January, as sales and output growth retreated to a 14-month low, according to the HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by S&P Global.
Manufacturing PMI fell to 56.3 in February from 57.7 in January. A PMI reading above 50 indicates an expansion.

"DGFT extends export obligation period for walnut imports, may benefit US exporters",https://www.livemint.com/economy/dgft-us-trade-walnut-imports-indian-importers-us-exporters-donald-trump-import-duty-11743090165270.html,"New Delhi:In another move that may benefit US exporters dealing in walnut shipments to India, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has extended the export obligation period for walnuts imported under the Advance Authorisation scheme, aligning it with the standard 18-month timeline applicable to most other products.
The move provides relief to traders, who previously had to adhere to a much shorter deadline for re-exporting processed walnuts, and is expected to benefit India’s key suppliers, including the US.
While explaining the DGFT notification, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) founder Ajay Srivastava said, “With a longer timeframe—18 months instead of 180 days—to process and re-export walnuts, Indian traders can plan their imports more efficiently without the pressure of a short turnaround.”
This could lead to increased purchases from the US, which supplies a significant share of India's walnut imports, he said.
Until now, importers bringing in in-shell walnuts under the scheme were required to export the shelled product within 180 days. This shorter obligation period is common for select commodities such as tea and raw sugar (180 days) and gold (120 days), where a faster turnaround is mandated.

However, in a shift from this approach, DGFT’s Public Notice No. 52, issued on 27 March, eliminated the 180-day constraint for walnuts, allowing them to be treated on par with other items under the Advance Authorisation scheme.
The extension comes as India continues to be a major importer of walnuts, with shipments worth $1.6 billion recorded in 2024. The US remains the dominant supplier, accounting for 66.8% of total imports, or about $1.07 billion, according to commerce ministry data.
The policy change could help boost demand for US walnuts by easing the export obligation timeline, giving Indian importers more flexibility in processing and re-exporting them, as per GTRI.

A day before President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he may grant many countries 'breaks' from his reciprocal tariff move—without providing details—India decided on Monday to drop the so-called Google tax, a levy on multinational companies providing services in India, in an apparent move to placate the US.
A day later, on Tuesday, India's tax regulator revised income tax rules to offer greater benefits toelectric vehicle(EV) and EV battery makers. A circular from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) expanded safe harbour rules by raising the eligibility threshold from₹200 crore to₹300 crore.
Lithium-ion batteries for electric andhybrid vehicleshave been classified as core auto components, making them eligible for tax benefits. These changes are seen as part of India's strategy in ongoing trade talks with the US, where it is seeking better market access for its exports.
To be sure, India has revised tariffs on several US products to address trade concerns. The import duty on bourbon whiskey has been reduced from 150% to 100%. Tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles have been lowered from 50% to 30%, and the duty on ethernet switches has been cut from 20% to 10%.

"India unlikely to retaliate against Trump tariffs, focus on bilateral trade deal",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-unlikely-to-retaliate-against-trump-tariffs-focus-on-bilateral-trade-deal-11743938717994.html,"Indiais unlikely to immediately retaliate against President Donald Trump’s tariff imposition, and is focusing efforts on negotiating a bilateral trade deal with the US to bring down duties, according to a Indian government official.
TheSouth Asian countryis seeking dialogue and not confrontation, the official said, adding that India has first mover advantage compared to rivals in the region. India plans to work toward a balanced and equitable trade deal with the US, the official said.
All options are up for negotiation, and both goods and services will be discussed, according to the official. The government is also in touch with exporters on the expected impact and will help if they reach out.
Trump last week announced a 26% tariff on US imports from India, dealing a blow to exporters and risking exacerbating a slowdown in an economy already suffering from weak consumer confidence. A lower negotiated rate could provide some relief, though escalating global trade tensions are still a threat.
During his visit to Washington after Trump’s return to the Oval Office, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the US president agreed to negotiate a bilateral trade deal by the fall of this year.
The new tariffs are a setback for Modi’s government, which had already made several concessions to Trump on his trade and immigration agenda and indicated willingness to cut duties further on imports from America during a visit of US trade officials to New Delhi last month.
India’s restraint from immediate retaliation contrasts with its neighbor China, which decided to impose a 34% retaliatory tariff on all goods imported from the US.
The NSE Nifty 50 Index fared better than most Asian peers last week as the impact of the levies was deemed milder than that for other economies.

Credit to industry rises 7.3 pc as on fortnight ended Feb 21: RBI data,https://www.livemint.com/economy/credit-to-industry-rises-7-3-pc-as-on-fortnight-ended-feb-21-rbi-data-11743093766953.html,"Mumbai, Mar 27 (PTI) Credit to industry expanded by 7.3 per cent in the fortnight ended on February 21, 2025, compared with 8.4 per cent in the year-ago period, according to Reserve Bank data released on Thursday.
Among major industries, outstanding credit to 'petroleum, coal products and nuclear fuels', 'all engineering', 'construction', and 'paper & paper products' recorded an accelerated y-o-y growth, it said.
Credit to agriculture and allied activities registered a growth of 11.4 per cent (y-o-y) as on the fortnight ended February 21, 2025 (20 per cent for the corresponding fortnight of the previous year).
RBI released the data on sectoral deployment of bank credit for February 2025 collected from 41 select banks, accounting for about 95 per cent of the total non-food credit deployed by all scheduled commercial banks.
On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, non-food bank credit as on the fortnight ended February 21, 20253 grew at 12 per cent as compared to 16.6 per cent for the corresponding fortnight of the previous year (February 23, 2024).
The data also showed that credit to services sector recorded a growth of 13 per cent (y-o-y) as on the fortnight ended February 21, 2025 (21.4 per cent for the corresponding fortnight of the previous year), with a decelerated growth in credit to ‘non-banking financial companies’ (NBFCs).
However, credit growth to ‘computer software’ accelerated and credit growth remained robust in ‘professional services’ and ‘trade’ segments.
Credit to personal loans segment registered a growth of 14 per cent as compared with 18 per cent a year ago, largely due to decline in growth rate in ‘other personal loans’, ‘credit card outstanding’ and ‘vehicle loans’ segments.

Trump to Unveil Country-Based Tariffs April 2 in Rose Garden,https://www.livemint.com/economy/trump-to-unveil-country-based-tariffs-april-2-in-rose-garden-11743445356558.html,"Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. .
President Donald Trump will announce his reciprocal tariff push on Wednesday during an event in the White House Rose Garden, his top spokeswoman said.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday the announcement would feature “country-based” tariffs. She said the president is also “committed to implementing” sectoral duties but that they were not the focus of the April 2 event and deferred to Trump about the timing of those. Members of Trump’s Cabinet would attend the announcement, Leavitt said.
“The president will be announcing a tariff plan that will roll back the unfair trade practices that have been ripping off our country for decades,” Leavitt told reporters at the White House. “It’s time for reciprocity and it’s time for a president to take historic change to do what’s right for the American people.”
Leavitt declined to provide details when asked about the rate of the reciprocal tariffs and which countries would be hit. She said there are “no exemptions at this time” in response to a question about whether lower duties would be applied to products used by American farmers.
The spokeswoman pointed to examples of tariff rates from the European Union, Japan, India and Canada while speaking to reporters, signaling those entities are among the targets of the president’s new levies.
Trump has billed April 2 as the launch of sweeping duties that are the centerpiece of his plan to rebalance global trade, boost US manufacturing and inject tariff revenue into government coffers to fund domestic priorities, including a major tax cut.
But the uncertainty surrounding his plans have triggered fears they could blow up supply chains and raise prices for US consumers, fueling a weeks-long selloff on Wall Street that extended into Monday.
“Wall Street will work out just fine in this administration, just like they did in the first term,” Leavitt said.

"AI, capital, startups & reforms will drive India’s growth to $8 trillion: Infosys’ Nandan Nilekani",https://www.livemint.com/economy/ai-capital-startups-reforms-will-drive-india-s-growth-to-8-trillion-infosys-nandan-nilekani-11741788488305.html,"India’s path to an $8 trillion economy by 2035 will be unlocked by artificial intelligence (AI), digital innovation, and deep economic reforms, says Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani.
At Arkam Ventures' Annual Meet on 12 March 2025, Nilekani laid out ""four great unlocks""—technology, capital, entrepreneurship, and formalization—that he believes can propel India's growth beyond current projections.
“We know what it means to build population scale, frugal, high volume low-cost infrastructure, and the same thing can be now applied to AI,” he said.
Nilekani outlined howIndiacan accelerate from a 6% to an 8% CAGR, enabling the economy to reach $8 trillion by 2035, by leveraging the key ""unlocks"".
The next digital transformation for a billion Indians will be driven by the fusion of India's digital public infrastructure (DPI) and AI, according to Nilekani.
“One of the goals of open source models like what is being built at AI4Bharat is to make sure that we have enough data in Indian languages which are spoken, as a public good,” Nilekani said, adding that such models would be beneficial to startups to build Indian language interfaces for products and services, thereby creating scale and reducing costs.
Also read:As India’s consumption landscape evolves, we must strengthen our economic recovery
“The same principles of high volume, low cost that India did with DPI will be applied to AI at a population scale with open data sets,” he said, adding that the technology's use cases should be in the areas of agriculture, languages, and education.
“By 2035, India will become the preferred IPO market globally,” according to Nilekani. He said that while India sees a higher number of IPOs compared to the US, American markets tend to have higher valuations. However, the key distinction lies in the level of active investments, where India is witnessing a significant surge.
Unlocking capital in India, according to Nilekani, will come from account aggregators, which currently allow for individuals to use the data of their transactions to get access to credit.
He believes this technology should be expanded to bring all credit-related services online. This includes better digitisation of GST data, business data, income tax returns, and non-government data.
“Everything should be online where I can get my data given to a lender and get a loan,” he said.
Secondly, India's real estate sector needs to embrace tokenization. “The tokenization of land assets using a proper ledger can unlock these things, where you can tokenize every piece of land, making it easily tradable,” Nilekani said.
Such a system would enable Indians to leverage their land as a financial asset, allowing them to either sell or use it as collateral for loans, ultimately fostering entrepreneurship and business creation.
Unlocking entrepreneurship in India hinges on integrating more startups into the national market, particularly those emerging beyond the top eight metros.
“Platforms like Meesho and ONDC will allow small guys to sell to our national market,” Nilekani said.
Also read:The state of India’s economy is not as bright as GDP data may suggest
According to the Ministry of MSMEs, India has approximately 63 million micro, small, and medium enterprises. If these businesses are brought online and connected to the broader digital economy, at least 10 million of them could evolve into “truly modern enterprises because they have access to technology,” Nilekani emphasised.
Digitalisation and the entry of GenZ workers will reimagine work across the board, whether its formal jobs, gig workers, or even entrepreneurs. But in order for these jobs to be formalised, two things need to happen, according to the Indian billionaire.
“We need to dramatically simplify our laws,” Nilekani said, pointing out that many of India's regulations are remnants of its colonial past. However, if the country aims to nurture a million entrepreneurs by 2035, “this doesn't work anymore,” he added.
Secondly, for India to formalise its workforce at a population scale, there needs to be a “nationally portable credential system and a nationally portable benefit system.”

Average US rate on a 30-year mortgage falls slightly to 6.65% after rising for 2 weeks,https://www.livemint.com/economy/average-us-rate-on-a-30-year-mortgage-falls-slightly-to-6-65-after-rising-for-2-weeks-11743092165070.html,"The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. fell slightly this week, a welcome reversal for homebuyers in what is traditionally the busiest time of the year for the housing market.
The rate fell to 6.65% from 6.67% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.79%.
This is the first decline in the average rate after rising two weeks in a row. The average rate has been mostly trending lower since mid-January, when it climbed to just over 7% — a welcome trend for aspiring homebuyers struggling to afford a home after years of soaring home prices.
Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, rose this week, however, pushing the average rate to 5.89% from 5.83% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.11%, Freddie Mac said.
Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including bond market investors’ expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions.
The overall decline this year in the average rate on a 30-year mortgage loosely follows the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.
The yield, which was nearing 4.8% in mid-January, has mostly fallen since then, reflecting rising unease over the Trump administration’s escalating tariffs on imported goods, which economists warn could drive inflation higher, hurting economic growth. The yield was at 4.37% in midday trading Thursday.
Bond investors demand higher returns as long as inflation remains elevated, so if inflation ticks upward that could translate into higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing up mortgage rates.
For now, the economic uncertainty is helping lower mortgage rates, just as the spring homebuying season ramps up.
The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.
Easing mortgage rates and more homes on the market nationally helped drive home sales higher in February from the previous month, though they were down year-over-year.

Jaguar Land Rover presses ‘pause’ on US export as Donald Trump’s 10% ‘baseline tariffs’ commences | 10 key highlights,https://www.livemint.com/economy/from-jaguar-land-rover-us-export-pause-to-donald-trumps-10-baseline-tariffs-10-key-highlights-of-day-1-11743870122869.html,"Trump Tariffs:US President Donald Trump's “baseline” tariffs have come into effect globally on Saturday, April 5, as tensions rise about the escalating trade war between theUnited Statesand other nations.
According to multiple media reports, the initial 10 per cent “baseline” tariffs came into effect for US airports, seaports, and custom warehouses at 12:01 a.m. (EDT) on Saturday, April 5.
Australia, Britain, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are among the first nations to be hit with the 10 per cent tariffs, with no grace period for ships and cargo on the US waters at midnight on Saturday.
1. Trump's response to stock market crash:US PresidentDonald Trumpon Saturday hailed the US tariffs on other nations even after the stock market crash, which wiped out more than $5 trillion in market cap, the biggest fall since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Calling it a “$5 trillion of investment” and “economic revolution,” Trump reassured the people of America and investors to “hang tough” through this phase, which he estimates will not be easy. Donald Trump aims to make America great again with this tariff war.
2. Jaguar Land Rover ‘pause’ shipments:After the announcement of the reciprocal tariffs, UK-based Tata Group-owned car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, in a statement cited by AFP, said that they are putting a “pause” on their shipments to theUnited Statesas the “new trading terms” come into effect.
“The USA is an important market for JLR's luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans,” said the company in a statement, as per the agency report.
3. China's reaction on market crash:Earlier on Saturday, Chinese Foreign Ministry reacted to the US stock market and said that the United States should stop doing the “wrong things” and work to resolve its differences with its trading partners.
“Now is the time for the U.S. to stop doing the wrong things and resolve the differences with trading partners through equal-footed consultation,” said the spokesperson Guo Jiakun in a Facebook post.
China also termed Donald Trump'sreciprocal tariffsas “unprovoked and unjustified.”
4. 10% tariffs on UK products:Donald Trump's 10 per cent tariffs on UK products also came into effect on Saturday, right after global stock markets and investors continued to show signs of concern about the escalating trade war between the US and other world nations.
FTSE 100 plummeted on Friday, along with the Dow Jones, which registered more than 2,200 points drop. The US markets witnessed its biggest drop since the world was hit by the pandemic in 2020.
5. US President on Fed rate cuts:Donald Trump on Friday urged US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut the key benchmark interest rates as he cited lower energy prices and low inflation along with growth in job rates.
6. China's 34% additional tariffs:China on Friday announced 34 per cent additional tariffs on all imports from the United States as a counter-move against US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2.

Heavy debt supply to further push up cost of borrowing for Indian states,https://www.livemint.com/economy/heavy-debt-supply-to-further-push-up-cost-of-borrowing-for-indian-states-11741162771172.html,"By Dharamraj Dhutia
MUMBAI, March 5 (Reuters) - Heavier-than-expected supply of debt from Indian states has resulted in a jump in the premium they pay over the corresponding central government bonds, and this is set to rise further as the overall supply is on track to hit a record high in fiscal 2025.
BY THE NUMBERS
Indian states raised 505 billion rupees ($5.80 billion)through the sale of bonds on Tuesday. The quantum was the highest for this financial year, with yields on the 10-year bonds in 7.21%-7.34% range.
The cutoff yields rose to their highest level in over seven months. The 10-year benchmark bond yield was around 6.73%, leading to a spread with state debt 48-61 basis points, highest level in 13 months.
CONTEXT
State governments generally pay a premium above central government bonds yields as they are quasi-sovereign in nature.
WHY ITS IMPORTANT
State governments are responsible for a considerable share of total government spending, which has led to an increase in borrowing over the last few years.
Heavy state borrowing would also increase the country's overall debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio, though the federal government is adhering to fiscal prudence with lower targets for fiscal deficit and borrowing.
Long-term investors such as insurance companies, provident funds and pension funds are major investors for state debt, and due to heavy supply from states, their demand for 30- and 50-year central government bonds has eased.
New Delhi has been targeting a bulk of their borrowing through such ultra-long bonds.
KEY QUOTE
""States are likely to borrow despite the comfortable cash position given inclination to fully utilize borrowing limits, but funding can be correspondingly lower at start of next fiscal,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, senior economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.
""At the same time as state debt supply has picked up, there could be some concerns on the demand side that may be weighing on sentiment.""
GRAPHIC
WHAT'S NEXT
Market participants anticipate the spreads to widen further as more supply from states in anticipated. They are scheduled to sell debt worth an additional 1.35 trillion rupees in the last three weeks of March, with traders anticipating the actual supply to outpace the calendar.

US delegation’s New Delhi visit set to boost trade talks as Trump tariffs loom,https://www.livemint.com/economy/us-india-trade-talks-trump-tariff-plan-india-india-us-trade-deficit-brendan-lynch-india-visit-donald-trump-tariffs-11742828240284.html,"New Delhi: As the deadline for US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff plan approaches, a US delegation led by assistant US trade representative Brendan Lynch is set to arrive in New Delhi on Tuesday for bilateral trade discussions.
Trump is expected to announce the reciprocal tariff plan on 2 April for all countries, including India, as part of efforts to correct the US's trade imbalance. The US currently has a trade deficit with India and several other countries.
Lynch, who oversees trade relations with South and Central Asia, will be in India from 25-29 March for meetings with Indian officials, a US embassy spokesperson said.

The visit of the US team is seen as a sign of Washington’s commitment to fostering a balanced and productive trade relationship with India, as both nations have agreed to finalise a bilateral trade agreement by the fall of 2025.
India also views this as an official channel to advance discussions that New Delhi had with its counterparts during a high-level delegation led by commerce minister Piyush Goyal from 4-8 March.
Commenting on the development, Goyal said, ""As directed by the leaders of the two countries, India remains committed to working with the US in trade and economic domains to enhance prosperity and innovation in both India and the US, and to deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.""
“We look forward to productive and constructive discussions with the incoming U.S. delegation to expand and deepen our bilateral trade and economic ties in a mutually beneficial manner,” Goyal added.
The proposed BTA aims to expand bilateral trade from $200 billion to $500 billion by 2030. AsMintreported on 18 February, India is seeking mutual tariff reductions from the US. With negotiations progressing in a positive direction, both nations have agreed to lower tariffs to benefit each other and facilitate trade expansion.

“Both countries now have a better understanding of each other’s concerns as they work towards finalising the contours of the bilateral trade agreement. The visit of the US delegation will scale up the talks and resolve the sticky issues,” said a senior government official who did not wish to be named.
Key concerns of the US include high tariffs on agricultural products, an uneven playing field in the e-commerce sector, and non-tariff barriers restricting access for its goods and services.
India has already lowed some duties, including tariffs on motorcycles, benefiting US premium bikemaker Harley Davidson, as well as bourbon whiskey and ethernet products, among others. The tariff on motorcycles was reduced from 50% to 30%, te duty on ethernet switches was cut from 20% to 10%, and the tariff on bourbon whiskey dropped from 150% to 100%.
India’s exports to the US stood at $75.60 billion in FY22, and increased to $78.31 billion in FY23 before declining slightly to $77.52 billion in FY24. From April to February of FY25, exports totaled $76.38 billion, up from $70.01 billion during the same period in FY24, according to commerce ministry data.
The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has suggested that India consider absorbing Trump's tariffs while withholding concessions in other areas. According to GTRI’s founder Ajay Srivastava, Trump's trade policies, though temporary, could have a significant impact, as seen in the previous trade war that began in March 2018 and led to a $762-billion surge in US goods imports between 2017 and 2023.
“A new trade war under Trump could be even more damaging, especially if retaliatory counter-tariffs escalate tensions further, potentially harming partners like India,” Srivastava said.
To avoid such a scenario, GTRI recommended that India refrain from direct retaliation and instead adopt a strategic approach. “Rather than engaging in a tariff war, India should gradually reduce its dependence on the US by avoiding preferential treatment in sectors such as oil purchases, defense deals, and other key areas. The focus should be on strengthening domestic industries to prepare for the next phase of global trade,” Srivastava said.

However, in a fact sheet on Fair and Reciprocal Tax signed by Trump before his meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 13 February, Washington highlighted tariff disparities, noting the US applies a 5% MFN (most-favoured nation) tariff on agricultural goods, while India’s is 39%. It also highlighted India’s 100% tariff on American motorcycles, compared to the US’s 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles, as an example of imbalance in market access.
After meeting Modi at the White House on 13 February and calling him a friend, Trump, who had earlier labelled India a “tariff abuser”, repeated his complaints at a joint press conference about the country’s trade policies, calling India's import duties “very unfair and strong”, and made it clear that India would not be spared from his tariff hikes on key trade partners.
Commerce ministry data shows that import duties on several high-value American products into India are negligible. For instance, in FY24, petroleum crude—the US’s top export to India at $5.03 billion—was taxed at just₹1 per tonne, making it one of the lowest-taxed imports despite its high trade value.
Other key exports from the US, including coal ($4.2 billion in FY24), large aircraft ($1.94 billion), and liquefied natural gas ($1.41 billion), carry a 2.5% tariff, ensuring steady trade in the energy and aviation sectors.
With a $35-billion merchandise trade surplus in FY24, India wants to avoid US tariff hikes on key exports such as garments, electronics, engineering goods and pharmaceuticals. Exports in these four categories rose from $38.84 billion in FY22 to $46.43 billion in FY24.

"India’s FY26 growth outlook remains resilient, but global trade risks loom, say rating agencies",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-fy26-growth-outlook-global-trade-war-trump-tariffs-rating-agencies-11743507205067.html,"New Delhi: India’s economic growth is expected to remain resilient during FY26, supported by sustained government spending and a potential revival in private investments, several rating agencies said in their FY25 rating assessments released on Tuesday, but warned of risks to exports from escalating US tariffs and a widening trade war.
India Ratings & Research, a Fitch Group company, said it expects the economy to grow at 6.6% in FY26, but warned thatrating actions could moderate during the fiscal year. Rating actions encompass all changes made by a credit rating agency, including initial assignments, revisions, outlook changes, suspensions, and withdrawals.
According to the rating agency, sectors like power, auto and auto components, road infrastructure, consumer services, and healthcare have performed well with rating upgrades over the past four years, driven by government-led infrastructure investments and strong urban demand.
Improving rural consumption, supported by higher disposable incomes, has further boosted the services sector. However, textiles, construction, and capital goods have faced downward rating actions due to raw material price volatility and rising working capital pressures.
During FY25, India Ratings upgraded 330 issuers of debt, while downgrading 94.
""Sound domestic consumption demand amidst an uptick in rural demand, continued government focus on capex spending and strong services growth supported robust economic growth,"" India Ratings & Research said in its Corporate Credit Profile FY25 report.
""However, macroeconomic instability from pockets of demand slowdown, rising delinquencies in retail credit, and uncertainties from United States tariff hikes in the last quarter constrained the momentum...Evolving landscape from tariff war and its possible ensuing impact on credit profiles set a cautious tone,"" it added.
Meanwhile, Crisil Ratings said in its H2, FY25 Ratings Roundup that the credit quality outlook for Indian firms is expected to be positive for FY2026, as domestic demand is expected to strengthen across three key sectors of the economy – capital goods, construction and retail.
On the upcoming US reciprocal tariffs, slated to come into effect from 2 April, Crisil Ratings expect sectors, other than smartphones, to see low to moderate impact on their business risk profiles as strong corporate balance sheets will provide adequate room to absorb this impact without affecting credit quality.

A blanket 25% US tariff on steel, aluminium, and auto components is expected to have a moderate impact, though direct US market dependence is low, the rating agency said.
Crisil Ratings said as many as 409 upgrades and 228 downgrades were recorded for domestic companies during the period, with the credit ratio standing at 2.64 times during H2, FY25, a tad lower than 2.75 times in the first half.
""Corporate India would benefit from the urban consumption spur driven by budgetary tax cuts, easing inflation and expected reduction in interest rates,"" said Subodh Rai, Managing Director, Crisil Ratings.
""Further, steadfast spending on infrastructure will have a positive multiplier effect and support linked sectors,"" he added.
According to the rating agency Icra, the tepidness in India’s merchandise exports is expected to continue in the near term amid the ongoing tariff tussles with services export growth likely to outpace merchandise export growth.
During FY24, India's merchandise exports stood at about $427 billion, down 3.1% annually, while imports stood at about $678 billion, down 5.27% annually, according to data from the commerce and industry ministry.
Indian tariffs are relatively high compared to many other countries.
India’s ‘Most Favoured Nation or MFN-applied trade-weighted average tariff rate’ stands at 12%, according to the World Trade Organisation. By comparison, the rate for others are as follows: Korea (8.4%), Brazil (6.7%), Indonesia (5.3%), China (3.0%), Mexico (3.9%), the EU (2.7%), Canada (3.4%), and the US (2.2%).

""While product-wise tariffs vary, the comparison above provides a simplified view of the tariff differentials between India and the US. Given the possibility of reciprocal tariffs being levied by the US on India (as has been done on other countries), Indian exporters will need to navigate trade flow adjustments,"" Icra said.
""Additionally, US tariff actions are likely to exert downward pressure on the INR against the USD, which could partially offset the impact on export revenues in INR terms,"" it added.
Icra said that while the overall consumption growth had lagged behind GDP growth in FY23 and FY24, the uptick in FY25 has been driven mostly by rural demand, with urban demand growth remaining modest.
However, a recovery is expected in FY26 with tax relief announced in the annual budget, lower food inflation, rate cuts, and other enablers, the rating agency added.
The imposition of US tariffs could disrupt export-driven sectors, particularly those reliant on discretionary spending, and lead to increased price competition from other affected economies, said Sachin Gupta, executive director and chief rating officer at CareEdge Ratings, adding that the uncertainty may keep private sector capital expenditure on hold until clearer signals emerge.
""That said, not all is bleak—trade agreements and rupee depreciation could offer much-needed relief to exporters. At the same time, Corporate India’s strong, deleveraged balance sheets act as a sturdy shield against external volatility,"" Gupta added.
CareEdge Ratings’ Credit Ratio improved to 2.35 times in H2 FY25, up from 1.62 times in H1 FY25, with 386 upgrades and 164 downgrades during the period.

"Over 1,600 Financial Firms Tapped Fed’s Emergency Lending Tool",https://www.livemint.com/economy/over-1-600-financial-firms-tapped-fed-s-emergency-lending-tool-11741813372384.html,"(Bloomberg) -- More than 1,600 banks and their subsidiaries tapped the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending program created to support the industry during the regional banking turmoil two years ago.
Beal Bank USA and First Republic Bank took out the biggest loans through the Bank Term Funding Program, which was established in March 2023 to bolster liquidity within the financial system after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. At their peak, they each borrowed loans in excess of $8 billion from the Fed, according to data released from the Fed on Wednesday.
Ranging from the largest global systemically important firms to community institutions, banks borrowed $168 billion through the BTFP during a peak, one-week period last year.
The BTFP was created under the Fed’s emergency authority given the “unusual and exigent circumstances” of early 2023, when Silicon Valley Bank became the biggest US lender to fail in more than a decade after a massive cash exodus. Trouble in the regional banking industry, at the time, had stirred concern among investors that a bigger crisis was brewing.
The program offered a solution to one of the financial system’s main challenges of 2023: giving banks and credit unions the ability to borrow funds for as long as a year.
Back then, the Fed had been raising interest rates at the fastest clip since the 1980s, pushing investors to park cash in Treasury bills, money markets and other higher-yielding instruments. Bank deposits, therefore, fell, and institutions had to boost rates on offerings like certificates of deposit to stem outflows and tap wholesale funding markets.
Once the BTFP was introduced, though, concern about evaporating bank deposits and unrealized losses on securities eased.
Arbitrage Trade
Still, the program was not without controversy. Some institutions started using the loans as part of an arbitrage trade.
At one point in late January 2024, banks could borrow a loan through the program at a rate of roughly 4.90%, or the one-year overnight index swap rate plus 10 basis points. Then, they could take the cash and park it, risk-free, at the Fed and get paid the Fed’s then rate of interest on reserve balances — which was then 5.4% — for it.
To sweeten the deal, the BTFP loans came with generous terms including the ability for banks to pay them back early for no penalty and to pledge US Treasuries and agency debt as collateral valued at par.
Usage of the BTFP reached a peak as some lenders got in on the opportunity, then plunged after the Fed changed the rules on the loans’ rate.
After the rate tweak, early loan repayments accelerated. The Fed’s half-percentage point interest-rate cut in September pushed rates below the terms of the banks’ loans, making it optimal to repay.
The Fed’s rate-cutting cycle has since led to further repayments, with the final loans due on March 11.

"Economic outlook for FY26 looks better with sharp rebound in govt spending, reduction in inflation: Geojit’s Vinod Nair",https://www.livemint.com/economy/economic-outlook-for-fy26-looks-better-with-sharp-rebound-in-govt-spending-reduction-in-inflation-geojits-vinod-nair-11743337455487.html,"The Indian stock market closed FY25 with a subdued performance. The broad market delivered a modest return of 5.35%, a significant decline from the exceptional 39% recorded in FY24. FY25 downturn accelerated in the latter half of the fiscal year, driven by a sharp decline in earnings growth.
In FY24, corporate earnings inIndiaexhibited robust expansion, exceeding 20%, which contributed to the market's strong performance. During FY25 initial period, expectations remained optimistic underpinned by a stable domesticeconomy. For example, RBI had projected 7.2% real GDP growth in its June 2024 policy review. However, actual economic conditions proved less favourable, as weak capital expenditure, particularly in a year dominated by elections, weighed on growth prospects. In FY26, India witnessed 10 elections, including the national election, which led to restrictions on new and ongoing government capital and revenue expenditures. Additionally, the rural economy suffered from the adverse effects of heatwave, an uneven monsoon, and persistently high inflation, which weighed heavily on the agriculture and allied sectors.
Declining earnings triggered substantial selling by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) from September onward, as Q2 results indicated a modest 5% earnings growth for H1FY25—far below the market’s expectation of 16% EPS growth for FY25. At that time, India was trading at a premium valuation of 21.3x one-year forward P/E. FII started to book profits and shift funds to other EMs like China, which was very cheap at 10x P/E, and to safer developed markets like the US & Europe. Meanwhile, the US was still growing well, and its domestic financial market was demanding dollar routing back to the economy as per the quantitative tightening measure.
FII selling accelerated as India struggled to justify its premium valuation. The trend further deepened between January and March as domestic inflows weakened too due to a sustained decline in portfolio values, driven by downturns in both domestic and global markets. By then, globalinvestorsentiment had turned cautious amid uncertainties surrounding Trumponomics. The US market sell-off increased recently, S&P 500 fell by 10% as tariff bomb shelves intensifying, which is feared to slow the US and global economy.
The late introduction of a 25% tariff on car & parts imports is likely to affect key players like Japan, Korea and Germany. For Indian component players for which the North American market is a high business mix, they can lose ground in the long-term. However, ongoing discussions between U.S. and Indian officials to finalize a bilateral trade agreement may help mitigate the adverse effects of these tariffs. Further, trade uncertainty is also weighing on Indianpharmaceutical stocks, as the industry remains a key supplier to the U.S. market and faces potential risks from reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on April 2.
For FY26 the domestic economic outlook appears better with a sharp rebound in domestic government spending, a reduction in inflation and a drop-in interest rate. High-frequency monthly data reflects rising demand across both rural and urban markets. This trend is expected to continue as India remains more reliant on domestic consumption thanexportsreducingtariffeffect. With increasing domestic demand and moderating inflation, corporate earnings are projected to grow toward the long-term average of 15% in FY26-27, up from the estimated 7% in FY25.
While FY25 ends on a muted note, FY26 appears more promising, as the key challenges are largely factored in. The Indian broad market has undergone a 20% correction, effectively pricing in these challenges. Subsequently, India’s valuation is expected to improve, with the stock market likely to perform better in the first half of FY26 compared to the latter half of FY25. Q4FY25 results to be announced from next week will provide the leads to FY26 performance.

No fiscal constraint on capex; govt’s fiscal prudence firm: FM Sitharaman,https://www.livemint.com/economy/no-fiscal-constraint-on-capex-govt-s-fiscal-prudence-firm-fm-11743523410584.html,"Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Tuesday that the centra; government’s capital expenditure has increased over the years, including in FY25, despite last year's national elections and that there is no fiscal constraint in this regard.
Sitharaman also said in a social media post that the NDA government’s fiscal prudence stands firm, reflective of ground realities and transparent fiscal management.
The minister said in a social media post that the revised estimate for the Centre’s capital expenditure in FY24 was₹9.5 trillion, and the same for the financial year that ended on 31 March was₹10.18 trillion.
“This clearly indicates an increase of 7.3%. There has been no cut in the capex of the central government,” the minister said.
Sitharaman’s statement is in response to former finance minister and Congress party leader P. Chidambaram’s statement on social media platform X that the Union government’s budgeted estimate (BE) of capital expenditure for FY25 was₹11.11 trillion, but revised to₹10.18 trillion in the revised estimates (RE).
“Budget estimates are prepared before the financial year begins and naturally evolve into revised estimates based on expenditure trends, implementation capacity, and emerging priorities. This is standard practice in public finance,” Sitharaman said.
“In FY25, capital expenditure was influenced by several factors: the model code of conduct during general elections, extreme weather events, and lower-than-expected spending by states and certain central agencies. Additionally, many states failed to submit utilization certificates, making further fund releases imprudent. Clearly, the revisions were not due to fiscal constraints,” Sitharaman said.
She said the budget estimate for the Union government’s scheme for special assistance to states for making capital investment (SASCI) for FY25 was₹1.50 trillion, and the revised estimate as on 1 February this year was₹1.25 trillion, but the actual release was above the revised estimates.
“I have mentioned in the House that the actual releases for SASCI (as of 26 March) in FY25 is₹1,46,362 crore,” the minister said, adding that this was an increase over the revised estimates.
The government presented this year’s budget on 1 February, proposing₹11.21 trillion in capital expenditure and another₹1.5 trillion to states under SASCI for FY26.

"Municipal bond issuances in India to exceed  ₹1,500 crore in FY 2025-26, driven by government push: ICRA",https://www.livemint.com/economy/municipal-bond-issuances-in-india-to-exceed-rs-1-500-crore-in-fy-2025-26-driven-by-government-push-icra-11742353846011.html,"New Delhi [India], March 19 (ANI): Municipal bond issuances in India are expected to raise more than₹1,500 crore in the Financial Year (FY) 2025-FY2026, primarily driven by the Government's push, according to a report by ICRA.
The report added that the share of Green/pooled bonds is also likely to increase, led by a growing focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives and enhancement in the credit profile of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).
The municipal bond market in India has gained significant traction in recent years, especially since FY2018, largely due to fiscal incentives introduced by the Government of India (GoI).
Since FY2018, the total amount raised in municipal bonds has exceeded₹2,600 crore, a substantial increase compared to the period between FY1998-FY2005 when less than₹1,000 crore was raised.
The growth in the Indian municipal bond market can largely be attributed to measures taken by the Government and regulators.
In 2015, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued the ""Issue and Listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities"" Regulations, which defined the status of municipal bonds and garnered investor interest.
Furthermore, in FY2018, the GoI initiated an incentive scheme, offering approximately₹13 crore for every₹100-crore bond issuance, providing a strong impetus for Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to use this financing mode.
The report added that despite the positive growth, there are several key challenges that continue to affect the municipal bond market.
These include ULBs' high dependence on government grants, lack of adequate and timely financial disclosures, illiquidity, the absence of a secondary market for bonds, high compliance requirements, and relatively weak credit quality of ULBs in accessing capital markets.
All municipal bond issuances since FY2018 have been supported by strong structured payment mechanisms.
These mechanisms have been instrumental in enhancing the credit ratings of the bonds, with all issuances receiving an AA rating, despite the diverse credit profiles of the underlying issuer ULBs.
Moving forward, most of the upcoming issuances are expected to follow similar structures and terms, the report added.
Since FY2018, approximately 17 municipal bonds worth about₹2,600 crore have been issued, with an average size of₹150 crore, as per the report.
ICRA also highlights that persistent challenges, such as improving the ULBs' own credit quality and addressing the lack of adequate disclosure and information systems, will remain crucial for the continued growth of a healthy municipal bond market in India. (ANI)

"US Seeks to Control Investment in Ukraine, Squeezing Out Europe",https://www.livemint.com/economy/us-seeks-to-control-investment-in-ukraine-squeezing-out-europe-11743093335827.html,"The US is pushing to control all major future infrastructure and mineral investments in Ukraine, potentially gaining a veto over any role for Kyiv’s other allies and undermining its bid for European Union membership.
President Donald Trump’s administration is demanding the “right of first offer” on investments in all infrastructure and natural resources projects under a revised partnership deal with Ukraine, according to a draft of the document obtained by Bloomberg News.
If accepted, the partnership agreement would bestow enormous power on the US to control investments into Ukraine in projects including roads and railways, ports, mines, oil and gas and extraction of critical minerals. It would represent an unprecedented expansion of US economic influence in Europe’s largest country by area just at the time when it’s attempting to align with the EU.
The agreement would grant the US first claim on profits transferred into a special reconstruction investment fund that would be controlled by Washington. Crucially, the document states that the US regards the “material and financial benefits” provided to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 as its contribution to that fund.
In effect, this would mean the Trump administration would compel Ukraine to pay for all of the US military and economic support provided since the start of the war before Kyiv received any income from the partnership fund.
The US delivered a revised agreement to officials in Kyiv last weekend after plans for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to sign an earlier accord fell apart following a tense Oval Office confrontation with Trump last month. The White House said last week that the administration was moving beyond the previously negotiated deal covering critical minerals in Ukraine.
Discussions are continuing between the two sides and the final draft may contain revisions to the terms. Ukraine will likely respond to the US document with its own amendments this week, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News.
The full agreement put forward by the US requires “detailed study” and the terms are changing constantly during negotiations, Zelenskiy told reporters in Paris on Thursday, where he’s attending a summit with European leaders. While it’s too early to say an agreement has been reached, “we support cooperation with the US, we don’t want to give a single signal that can prompt the US to stop aid to Ukraine,” he said.
The US remains committed to a quick conclusion to the agreement and to securing a lasting peace for both Ukraine and Russia, a US Treasury Department spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.
The US National Security Council didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Zelenskiy has sought to draw Ukraine’s allies into investing in the country as part of his so-called Victory Plan to help secure it against future Russian aggression. Trump put forward his own demands for a deal to access Ukraine’s critical minerals shortly after he took office in January, as compensation for US support in the war.
Trump has moved to strike agreement with Ukraine as he also presses Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a deal to end the war. So far, the US has pushed for Ukraine to make a series of concessions, including potentially giving up claims to territory occupied by Russia, while making practically no demands of Putin.
Ukraine secured EU candidate status in 2022 and is set to begin accession talks for full membership that could take years to complete. That’s likely to be further complicated if the US has effective control over investment decisions covering large areas of Ukraine’s economy.
Ukraine has previously said that a deal with the US must not conflict with its association agreement with the EU. It has also previously rejected the US push to include Washington’s past support for Ukraine as its contribution to the joint fund.
According to the draft document, the US International Development Finance Corporation would control the investment fund by nominating three of five board members and holding a “golden share” that gave it special voting rights to block certain decisions. Ukraine would name the other two and be prevented from intervening in the fund’s day-to-day management.
The government in Kyiv would be required to put 50% of its earnings from all the new natural resources and infrastructure projects into the fund. The US would have the right to all of the profit plus a 4% annual return until its investment had been recovered, the draft stated.
Ukraine would be obliged to present all projects to the fund for review “as early as practicable,” with the DFC gaining board seats or oversight on all funded programs. Kyiv would be barred from offering rejected projects to other parties with “materially better” terms for at least one year.
In addition, according to the draft, the US government would have the right to purchase Ukraine’s metals, minerals and oil and gas ahead of other parties on commercial terms, regardless of whether the fund was financing the project.
The deal, which has no time limit, also forbids Kyiv from selling critical minerals to countries that are “strategic competitors” of the US.

IEX records electricity traded volume of 121 billion units in FY25 on higher demand,https://www.livemint.com/economy/iex-electricity-traded-power-demand-day-ahead-market-renewable-energy-certificates-11743775064450.html,"The electricity traded on the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) reached a record high last fiscal as demand for power rose in the country.
IEX’s electricity traded volume rose 19% year-on-year to 121 billion units (BU) in FY25, according to its statement on Friday. India’s power consumption rose 4.4% during the fiscal.
Monthly trade volumes also reached a record 11,215 million units (MU) in March, marking a 29% year-on-year increase. The traded volumes increased as temperatures went up last month and commercial demand rose with businesses trying to close orders before the fiscal ended.
Citing government data, the statement said, in March India’s energy consumption reached 148 billion units, up 7% from a year earlier. On 11 March 2025, peak demand reached 235 GW, surpassing the maximum peak demand of 222 GW recorded in March 2024.
According to the exchange, despite the increase in power demand, the average market clearing price in the day ahead market (DAM) in March was₹4.47 per unit due to increased supply.
DAM is a physical electricity trading market which allows market participants to buy and sell electricity for the next day.
Amid surging power demand in the past few years, the ministry of power took proactive measures throughout the last fiscal to enhance supply. These include extending the directive for imported coal-based power plants to operate at full capacity, the sale of surplus un-requisitioned power on power exchanges, ensuring the availability of gas-based plants and higher availability of generating units to meet peak demand.
These measures, along with ample coal inventory around 21 days and no loss of generation in the fiscal year 2025, ensured sufficient supply liquidity in the system, said IEX.
""During the year, the sell liquidity in the DAM segment increased by 36% on a year-on-year basis, thereby keeping power prices competitive on the exchange. For FY25, the market clearing price in the Day Ahead Market was at₹4.47/unit, as compared to₹5.24/unit in FY24, marking a decline of 15% YoY,"" it said.
The peak power demand in FY25 was a record 250 GW, reached on 31 May. With the peak demand projected to touch a new high of 270 GW in the upcoming summers, robust trading of electricity on the exchanges is likely to continue this fiscal.
IEX said that during FY25, the bourse traded 178 lakh renewable energy certificates, marking a 136% year-on-year increase. One REC is equivalent to one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated from a renewable energy source such as solar, wind, or hydro.
RECs are an essential part of developing the renewable energy market, allowing companies and organizations to offset their carbon footprint by purchasing certificates without directly generating renewable energy themselves.
In March, 13 lakh RECs were traded, marking an 18% year-on-year increase.

Mizorams financial position shows significant improvement: CM,https://www.livemint.com/economy/mizorams-financial-position-shows-significant-improvement-cm-11743679628972.html,"Aizawl, Apr 3 (PTI) Mizoram Chief Minister Lalduhoma on Thursday said that the state's financial position showed a substantial improvement over the past one year because of several austerity measures taken by his government.
He said that the ZPM regime retained a cash balance of₹1,093 crore with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) at the end of 2024-2025 despite fiscal challenges.
The state's cash balance - the amount of money a government has to pay its bills, salaries and other expenses - at the end of the 2023-2024 fiscal was₹520 crore, the CM said.
The Zoram People's Movement (ZPM) came to power in December 2023.
Lalduhoma, who also holds the finance portfolio, said that retaining over₹1,000 crore cash balance is a rarity in the context of Mizoram, as the figure usually stood at₹100-200 crore earlier.
It also became negative when salaries and pensions for March were disbursed in the first month of the new financial year (April) in the past, he said while addressing a function in Aizawl.
""In spite of fiscal challenges and owing to austerity measures, we are able to retain a cash balance of₹1,093 crore with the RBI as on April 1 against₹520 crore balance on April 1, 2024. This is a clear indication of significant improvement in the state's financial position,"" Lalduhoma said.
The chief minister said that except for one occasion, his government did not slip into an overdraft since it assumed charge on 8 December 2023, he said.
He claimed that no ministers, MLAs or officials have indulged in corruption during the one and three months of the ZPM government.

"Sitharaman reaffirms push for regulatory reforms, trust-based governance to boost businesses, economy",https://www.livemint.com/economy/nirmala-sitharaman-finance-minister-regulatory-reforms-trust-based-governance-india-business-economy-11741091250700.html,"New Delhi: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday reiterated the central government’s commitment to reducing regulatory hurdles and fostering trust-based governance, saying the Union Budget reflects these priorities.
“We are taking decisive steps to transform India into a seamless, export-friendly economy—one where businesses are free to focus on innovation and expansion, not paperwork and penalties,” she said at a post-budget webinar organized by the Department of Financial Services, attended by policymakers and private sector representatives.
Highlighting the need for regulatory reforms, Sitharaman said decriminalizing business-related offences would help industries operate with greater confidence by reducing legal risks.
“A robust manufacturing sector free from unnecessary regulatory bottlenecks will further attract both domestic and foreign investments, driving economic growth,” she added.

The Union Budget, presented on 1 February, introduced a series of measures aimed at simplifying compliance, modernizing regulations, and attracting investment.
As part of this push, the budget proposed a light-touch regulatory framework to build a trust-based business environment.
She also announced the formation of a High-Level Committee for Regulatory Reforms to review non-financial sector regulations, certifications, licenses, and permissions, with a focus on streamlining processes and enhancing ease of doing business.
Additionally, an investment friendliness index of states, announced by her, will be introduced in 2025 to foster competitive cooperative federalism by evaluating states on their investment climate.
The government will also establish a mechanism under the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) to assess the impact of financial regulations and develop a more responsive regulatory framework for the financial sector, the finance minister had said in her budget speech.
The central government has also committed to reducing compliance burdens, with the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 decriminalizing over 100 legal provisions.
On Tuesday, Sitharaman highlighted the scale of ongoing regulatory simplifications, stating, ""Our government has removed over 42,000 compliances and decriminalized more than 3,700 legal provisions since 2014.""
Beyond regulatory reforms, the finance minister emphasized the government’s focus on capital expenditure as a key driver of economic growth.
She noted that large-scale infrastructure investments are strengthening industries, creating jobs, and laying the foundation for greater private sector participation.

""For the year 2025-26, total effective capital expenditure is proposed at₹15.48 trillion, which is 4.3% ofGDP, with₹11.21 trillion allocated as core capital expenditure by the Centre—equivalent to 3.1% of GDP,"" she said.
Sitharaman added that these measures would not only create a more business-friendly environment but also position India as a globally competitive hub for investment, fostering long-term economic growth and resilience.

Taiwan ready to assist India reduce trade deficit with China: Taiwanese Deputy NSA Hsu Szu-Chien,https://www.livemint.com/economy/taiwan-ready-to-assist-india-reduce-trade-deficit-with-china-taiwanese-deputy-nsa-hsu-szuchien-11742466462843.html,"New Delhi, Mar 20 (PTI) Taiwan can help India reduce its import of electronic components from China and the best way to bolster the economic engagement including in the semiconductor sector would be to seal a free trade pact, Taiwanese deputy national security adviser Hsu Szu-Chien said on Thursday.
In an exclusive interview to PTI, Hsu said a trade deal will pave the way for greater investment in India by Taiwanese companies in the high-technology sectors as it will help in bringing down the ""high tariffs"".
The Taiwanese deputy national security adviser was in the national capital to participate in the Raisina Dialogue, India's flagship conference on geopolitics, and hold talks with senior Indian officials.
Hsu said there can be a match-making between technology of Taiwan and India's demographic dividends to produce high-end technology components in India that will help New Delhi cut its imports from China.
""I think there's great potential for the relations to expand, especially on economic cooperation,"" Hsu said.
He said India can bring down its ""huge"" trade deficit with China by going for joint production of various electronics components instead of keep importing them from China.
""Most of these are ICT (information and communication technology) products, which from our perspective, India has great potential to produce. And Taiwan can be of help, not only semiconductor, but all other ICT products,"" he said.
""India itself is a huge market and you have a demographic dividend of a very young age of population, which can be put into the workforce.""
Leading Taiwanese companies are increasingly looking at relocating their production bases from China to countries in Europe, North America, the US and India in view of Washington's trade dispute with Beijing and Chinese military's increasing muscle flexing around Taiwan.
""So with the technology of Taiwan, with the demographic dividends, I do see a very bright future for economic cooperation,"" Hsu said.
India has a ballooning trade deficit with China as its imports from that country in 2023-24 totalled USD 101.75 billion as against exports of USD 16.65 billion, according to available data.
Major imports from China include electronic components, computer hardware, telecom equipment, chemicals and raw materials for pharmaceutical products.
Taiwan, a self-ruled island of more than 23 million people, produces over close to 70 per cent of the world's semiconductors and over 90 per cent of the most advanced chips that are required for almost all electronic equipment such as smartphones, car components, data centres, fighter jets and AI technologies.
Hsu also said that Taiwan is keen on having a trade pact with India. The idea of having a trade pact between the two sides was conceived around 12 years back.
Taiwan has a ""very strong intent"" to have trade negotiations with India, he said.
""It has to do with the fact that the tariff is really high. It's really not very good, especially for the medium and small-sized Taiwanese companies, high-tech companies, to come over to invest,"" he said.
""So to have a trade deal will be, from our perspective, mutually beneficial,"" he said, adding ""I hope, given the bright future I just described, I hope there will be renewed momentum from both sides to go ahead.""
The two sides have already conducted studies for the proposed FTA and held preliminary discussions for the pact.
India is Taiwan's 17th largest trading partner and under the ""Make in India"" policy, the total investment of Taiwanese enterprises in India has exceeded USD 4 billion covering areas from footwear, machinery, automobile components to petrochemical and ICT products, according to official data.
The India-Taiwan relations have witnessed some upswing in the last few years.
Last year, the two sides inked a migration and mobility agreement that will facilitate employment of Indian workers in diverse sectors in the self-ruled island. Both sides were engaged in discussions over the pact for several years.
China considers Taiwan as its breakaway province and insists it should be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Taiwan, however, sees itself as completely distinct from China.
Though India and Taiwan do not have formal diplomatic ties, the bilateral trade relations have been on an upswing.
In 1995, New Delhi set up the India-Taipei Association (ITA) in Taipei to promote interactions between the two sides and to facilitate business, tourism and cultural exchanges.
India-Taipei Association has also been authorised to provide all consular and passport services.
In the same year, Taiwan too established the Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre in Delhi.

"US, EU Officials Explore How to Move Forward in Trump’s Trade War",https://www.livemint.com/economy/us-eu-officials-explore-how-to-move-forward-in-trump-s-trade-war-11741977698186.html,"Senior members of the European Union’s executive arm and US officials spoke on Friday to explore ways to move forward after US President Donald Trump’s metals tariffs prompted a trade war.
EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic spoke with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to improve the understanding of each other’s position, the European official said.
“There’s a lot of work ahead but let’s stay focused and explore the best ways to move forward in the right direction,” Sefcovic said in a social media post.
Sefcovic’s call with his American counterparts came after Trump imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in a massive escalation of the trade war between the longstanding allies. The decision was shortly followed by the announcement of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, for additional tariffs targeting as much as €26 billion of US products.
While EU officials had hoped to enter into negotiations with the US following the implementation of the metal duties, Trump further escalated tensions by threatening to impose a 200% tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from the EU unless Brussels removes the announced tariffs, most of them expected to enter into force in mid-April.
In addition, EU officials are preparing additional measures to response to another round of US so-called reciprocal tariffs in just three weeks. Trump officials plan to apply an across-the-board rate to each country, based on a calculation of their own tariffs and other trade barriers, such as digital taxes or value-added levies.
Trump has also pledged separate sectoral tariffs on industries including autos, lumber, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and copper.

Canadians Spurn Flights to US as Trade War Resistance Grows,https://www.livemint.com/economy/canadians-spurn-flights-to-us-as-trade-war-resistance-grows-11743188018185.html,"Fewer Canadians are flying to the US as an escalating trade war between the nations alters vacation habits.
Air Canada has seen the transborder market soften, and WestJet bookings have shifted from the US to other destinations, according to spokespeople from Canada’s top two passenger air carriers.
Bookings made from Canada to the US fell by 13% in February and March compared with a year ago, according to data from Canadian website FlightHub.com. Searches for travel within Canada surged over the same period, toppling the US as the most-searched destination.
“The timing and magnitude of the booking decline, especially following the February 1 tariff announcement, suggest consumer confidence in cross-border travel was significantly impacted by geopolitical uncertainty,” FlightHub Chief Executive Officer Henri Chelhot said in a statement.
The change in travel patterns is part of a larger boycott of American products in response to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canadian goods and his desire to annex Canada. “Donald Trump wants to break us so America can own us,” Prime Minister Mark Carney warned at a campaign rally this week.
For airlines, the drop in US flight demand could hurt profits at a time when their bottom lines are already under pressure from weakness in the Canadian dollar and recession fears.
Air Canada, the country’s largest air carrier, said in an email that it’s responding to softer transborder demand by using smaller aircraft or reducing route frequency. For example, its previously non-stop flight between Vancouver and Washington, DC, now includes a stopover in Toronto. The airline also reduced capacity for routes to US leisure destinations such as Florida, Las Vegas and Arizona, it said in its latest earnings call.
WestJet has adjusted its schedule to fly more to Mexico, the Caribbean and transatlantic destinations, a spokesperson said by email.
Jet travel isn’t the only mode of transportation affected by Canadians’ boycott. Cross-border road trips by Canadian residents in February plunged 23% year over year, according to Statistics Canada.

According to multiple media reports, the additional tariffs from China will be effective from April 10.
“The purpose of the Chinese government's implementation of export controls on relevant items in accordance with the law is to better safeguard national security and interests, and to fulfill international obligations such as non-proliferation,” said the Commerce Ministry ofChina, reported the news agencyReuters.
China also announced that they will exercise more control on the exports of medium and heavy rare earth minerals like samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium to theUnited Stateseffective April 4, as per the report.
The nation also reportedly added 11 entities to the “unreliability list”, which allows the Asian nation to take action against foreign entities in the country.
US PresidentDonald Trump, on April 2, the day he marked as ‘Liberation Day’, announced 34 per cent reciprocal tariffs on China, on top of an earlier existing import duty of 20 per cent on the Asian nation.
This move from the US government brought tariffs on the import of Chinese goods to 54 per cent.
Earlier part of the first tariff wave, the United States, in an executive order, announced 10 per centtariffson goods imported from China.

Fiscal pressure on states to increase because of freebies; capex likely casualty: Emkay,https://www.livemint.com/economy/fiscal-pressure-on-states-to-increase-because-of-freebies-capex-likely-casualty-emkay-11742461680247.html,"New Delhi [India], March 20 (ANI): Several states are showing signs of fiscal pressure because of the freebies and capital investment is likely to be the casualty, said Emkay Global in its states finance report.
Highlighting the issue, the report said that states may try to rationalize their spending on these schemes but they will face pressure.
""Thus, while states may try to rationalize their spending on these schemes, the genie is now out of the bottle - we expect fiscal pressure on states to only increase from here on with capex (especially discretionary capex) likely to be the casualty,"" the report said.
The report says that the states are likely to spend less in the Financial Year (FY) 2025, to check the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio (by 20-30bps) than the budgeted 3.2 per cent.
However, the FY25 estimate of 3 per cent is still higher than FY24's 2.8 per cent, with several states facing fiscal stress.Of the 10 major state budgets for FY26, five states show either worsening or unchanged revenue balance-to-GDP ratios and an equal number have higher fiscal deficits.
The report says that the strain from the increased welfare spending is already visible--Maharashtra, for example, has cut funding for the 'Ladki Bahin' scheme from₹460 billion in FY25 to₹360 billion in FY26, removing ""ineligible beneficiaries"".
The revenue deficit-to-GDP is set to rise from 0.6 per cent in FY25 to 0.9 per cent in FY26 because of the₹2,100 monthly payout to women under the scheme.
So far, states have borrowed₹1.5 trillion in the month against Rs1.2 trillion, which is 26 per cent higher. This is on the back of much lower borrowing throughout the rest of Q4FY25, and indeed, the year. The report adds that the recent surge in borrowing has not been accompanied by higher spending.
Data for 19 states till Feb 25 shows that their total expenditure had shown only 10 per cent growth (vs 20 per cent budgeted), with revenue growing at 12 per cent (vs 19 per cent budgeted), whereas capex growth was negative (-4 per cent vs 20 per cent budgeted).
This is also corroborated by the cash balance of states which was as high as₹2.9 trillion at Feb-end (30 per cent higher than Feb-23). Lower spending can also be seen in the high unspent balances in various SNA accounts for Centrally Sponsored Schemes. (ANI)

Australia’s central bank still more cautious than market on prospect of more rate cuts,https://www.livemint.com/economy/australias-central-bank-still-more-cautious-than-market-on-prospect-of-more-rate-cuts-11742253353827.html,"By Alasdair Pal
SYDNEY, - Australia's central bank said on Tuesday it remained more cautious than the market about the prospects for further policy easing, after it cut interest rates for the first time in over four years last month.
The Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates by a quarter-point to 4.1% at its February meeting, with the board saying it did not want to lag other central banks that had already eased.
Market positioning currently implies a 65% probability the bank will cut again at its May policy meeting, with traders expecting a third cut by the end of the year.
But in a speech in Sydney on Tuesday, RBA Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter reiterated recent remarks by the bank's top policymakers that the market remained over-optimistic about the prospects for further rate cuts.
""As the Governor and Deputy Governor have both indicated recently, the February decision reflected a judgement by the board that it was the right time to take some restrictiveness away, but the board were more cautious than the market about prospects for further easing,"" said Hunter, who heads the central bank's economics unit.
Governor Michele Bullock and her deputy Andrew Hauser have both said in recent weeks that the bank does not believe a series of rate cuts will be required.
However, there remained a high degree of uncertainty about the RBA's central forecasts, Hunter said, with the board paying close attention in particular to the knock-on impact of policymaking by the United States.
""One of the things we are focused on right now is U.S. policy settings, the impact of these on the global economy and how this flows through to activity and inflation here in Australia,"" she said.
The U.S. Federal Reserve releases economic projections later this week that will provide the most tangible evidence yet of how U.S. central bankers view the likely impact of Trump administration policies that have clouded a previously solid economic outlook.
Turning to Australia, Hunter said a pick-up in household consumption in the December quarter was not a temporary bounce caused by seasonal spending, but reflected ""a genuine improvement in underlying momentum"".

"Bank Branch Closures Accelerate UK High Street Decline, PwC Says",https://www.livemint.com/economy/bank-branch-closures-accelerate-uk-high-street-decline-pwc-says-11742430779272.html,"Banks closing branches across Britain are fueling the decline of the country’s high streets, a report by advisory firm PwC found.
Almost 1,000 bank branches closed in the last two years on a net basis, forcing customers to travel further or use online services. That is having a knock-on effect on British shopping streets, with 10 retail or hospitality outlets closing on a net basis every day in 2024, the survey by Green Street for PwC showed.
“One of the main reasons that high streets are losing footfall is because there are far fewer banks,” Kien Tan, senior retail adviser at PwC, said by phone. “The number of banks has halved in 10 years. That’s massive.”
Banco Santander SA said this week it will close 95 branches in the UK, putting about 750 employees at risk of redundancy. Lloyds Banking Group Plc and NatWest Group Plc have also closed outlets, as traditional banks with costly real estate footprints and staffing needs come under pressure from more online-focused financial services rivals including Monzo Bank Ltd. and Revolut Ltd.
The trend has been going on for some time, with net closures of 1,795 in 2021 and 2022 combined. The data include building societies, insurance agents, bureaux de change and credit unions.
The struggles in the British retail sector are becoming a major political problem for the government, especially after Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves imposed higher costs on companies in her revenue-raising budget. Opposition parties accused her of hurting business and consumer confidence, which has undermined the governing Labour Party’s promise to spur growth.
Overall, there were 12,804 closures of chain outlets across British shopping destinations in 2024, according to the PwC report.
While that was an improvement on 2023, PwC found, the consultancy expects closures this year as retailers respond to higher national insurance contributions — a payroll levy — which kick in next month.
“Retailers continue to face significant challenges in 2025,” Zelf Hussain, restructuring partner at PwC, said in a statement. “With substantial payroll cost increases and higher business rates taking effect in April, profit margins will remain under pressure, further straining high street retailers.”
Pubs and pharmacies were also among the worst-hit categories last year. Boots said in 2023 the drug store chain would close 300 stores in the UK, while Lloyds Pharmacy confirmed its departure from the high street later that year.
Those closures also have political implications, as ministers try to shift more services to pharmacies to help the struggling National Health Service.
The report published Thursday tracked more than 200,000 chain outlets in 3,500 locations across Great Britain to show the changing character of high streets, shopping centers and retail parks. It doesn’t include independent stores.

Indias exports are bound to grow despite global uncertainties: DGFT,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-exports-are-bound-to-grow-despite-global-uncertainties-dgft-11742983828232.html,"New Delhi, Mar 26 (PTI) India's exports are bound to grow in the coming years despite uncertainties over global trade and tariff, a senior government official said on Wednesday.
Director General of Foreign Trade Santosh Kumar Sarangi said that exporters should tread the path pragmatically and wisely to navigate the current global trade contours.
He also said that the current scenario presents a ""golden"" opportunity for India to do a variety of things which will propel exports and increase manufacturing competitiveness.
Despite the ""uncertainties relating to trade and tariff, our exports are bound to grow in future years,"" he said at the Sourcex India 2025 show. It was organised by the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO).
US President Donald Trump has imposed reciprocal tariffs or import duties on countries like China and has pledged to impose these levies on India also on April 2.
Certain exporters have raised concerns that imposition of duties by the US on sectors like engineering and pharma will hurt shipments to America, which is the largest trading partner of India.
Sarangi said that in the current year, India's exports in goods and services will cross USD 800 billion. Last year it was USD 778 billion.
""While we see a temporary blip in exports (in the recent) months, in the longer run, our exporting communities have been giving us an impression that the number of order enquiries which they are receiving is fairly positive and that gives me the confidence that our exports will increase vis-a-vis our current levels,"" Sarangi said.
He added that steps like production linked incentive schemes to promote ease of doing business and boost domestic manufacturing are helping the domestic industry.
India's goods exports dipped for the fourth consecutive month by 10.85 per cent to USD 36.91 billion in February. It was USD 395.63 billion during April-February this fiscal. Services exports during the period are estimated at USD 354.90 billion.
Speaking at the event, FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai said that despite tariff-related concerns, India's exports will register a healthy growth rate.
""The order books are pretty good and the removal of tariff uncertainties will further push the shipments,"" Sahai said.

‘Impossible Trinity’ Conundrum Has Caused a Cash Crunch in Asia,https://www.livemint.com/economy/impossible-trinity-conundrum-has-caused-a-cash-crunch-in-asia-11741524603943.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Some of Asia’s biggest central banks are getting a painful refresher in economic theory.
Monetary authorities in China, India and elsewhere have waged a prolonged campaign against the strong dollar, using a mix of official reserves and opaque derivatives trades to defend their currencies. But their moves have pushed up borrowing costs for local banks just when slowing economies need more liquidity.
China’s overnight and seven-day repo rates surged in February, while bond investors took losses from a sharp rise in yields. Banking liquidity in India suffered its highest deficit in at least 14 years earlier this year and overnight borrowing costs jumped. Liquidity also dried up in Indonesia and Malaysia following central bank currency interventions.
These moves are explained by what economists call the impossible trinity, the idea that countries can’t simultaneously control their currencies, independently set interest rates and allow capital to move freely across borders. Something will break or give way.
“Under the impossible trinity, if a central bank opts to hold the currency stable and one assumes an unchanged capital account regime, rates have to be the adjustment mechanism. That will emerge initially in interbank money market rates,” said Philip McNicholas, an Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco.
Rising interbank rates are a sign of a cash shortage that could hit the wider economy, discouraging banks from lending and potentially crimping economic growth.
The impossible trinity underscores the complicated questions facing investors in emerging markets. Currency depreciation hits the value of the stocks and bonds foreign investors hold in these countries, but if stability comes at a cost to economic growth, the whole investment case can be undermined.
Pushing Back
One central bank is starting to push back against the side effects of defending its currency. The Reserve Bank of India said on March 5 that it would inject $21.5 billion into the financial system through a mix of bond purchases and swap auctions before the March 31 year-end, its latest attempt to offset the cash crunch.
The People’s Bank of China has so far held back from a similar round of big liquidity injections, keeping its focus on the currency. Although there were some hopes the tide was turning after the government unveiled an economic growth target of around 5%, an ambitious goal that will require looser monetary conditions, bond yields once again spiked on Friday.
Traders are now braced for a period of uncertainty in a year likely to be defined by US President Donald Trump’s swashbuckling approach to global trade. Central banks may be forced to play whack-a-mole: defending their currencies one day, and easing liquidity strains the next.
Read: INDIA REACT: RBI Adds Cash. FX Shorts Drain It. Rinse and Repeat
“The currency volatility could continue amid ongoing global trade and tariff wars and will imply emerging market central banks, including the RBI, will have to be on their toes on the FX front,” said Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai.
The rupee is likely to weaken to 89.50 per dollar by the end of the year, said Arora, a move of more than 3% from Friday’s levels.
Bank Indonesia has taken a novel approach to defending its currency, launching a new type of rupiah-denominated bill in September 2023 designed to attract capital inflows. But the securities have lured funds away from the banking system, and may have contributed to tightening liquidity, wrote Goldman Sachs strategists including Rina Jio and Danny Suwanapruti in a note on Feb. 26.
Bank Negara Malaysia has leaned on currency forwards to support the ringgit, swelling its net short forward book. That has combined with high loan-to-deposit ratios to tighten interbank liquidity, said Robeco’s McNicholas.
There is an irony to the pain being felt by central banks pushing back against a strong dollar. Stephen Miran, Trump’s pick as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, has written extensively about the costs to the US of a strong dollar — and traders have recently obsessed over the potential for a ‘Mar-a-Lago Accord’ that could lead to a prolonged period of dollar weakness.
That may not sound like such a bad idea to central bankers in Asia, who have increasingly been forced to confront their own costs from dollar strength.

"India, New Zealand aim to conclude free-trade deal in 60 days as Trump tariff war looms",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-new-zealand-fta-trump-tariffs-tariff-war-christopher-luxon-india-visit-piyush-goyal-india-new-zealand-trade-11742301573387.html,"New Delhi: India and New Zealand, which began negotiations on a free trade agreement (FTA) just two days ago, aim to conclude the deal in as little as 60 days, top officials from both nations said on Tuesday.
Speaking at the India-New Zealand Economic Forum, organised by industry body FICCI, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon expressed confidence in the trade ministers’ ability to fast-track the agreement.

“We have high expectations from our trade ministers,” Luxon said, adding with a touch of humour that if the trade ministers managed to wrap it up in 60 days, they might end up with a hairstyle like his. ""When we look at the trading relationship today… there's a huge opportunity for us here,” he added.
Speaking at the event, Piyush Goyal, minister of commerce and industry, said India also aspires to conclude the FTA quickly “What if we were to complete it in 60 days… I am sure together we can make a significant difference to the economies of India and New Zealand,” he said.
While ironing out the details of FTAs typically takes a long time, India and the UAE concluded their Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in a record 88 days before signing it on 18 February 2022.
On Sunday, India and New Zealand announced the launch of talks for an FTA as part of efforts to deepen economic cooperation amid the threat of a global tariff war sparked by US President Donald Trump. The decision was formalised during the ongoing visit of Prime Minister Luxon, who is in India from 16 to 20 March.

The discussions, led by Goyal and New Zealand’s trade and investment minister Todd McClay, mark a step towards stronger bilateral trade relations. ""Whether it's food processing, pharma, renewable energy, critical minerals, policy, horticulture, tourism, or sports, I think the sky is the limit. Education and research are also areas where we must focus because that's what makes people closer to each other,"" Goyal said. Bilateral trade between both nations could grow 10-fold in just a decade, he added.
""Manufacturing in India, producing in India for the world at competitive prices can help us take this partnership to greater heights,"" Goyal said.
Bilateral merchandise trade between India and New Zealand remained below $1 billion in FY24, with India’s goods exports at $538.3 million and New Zealand’s at $335.1 million, highlighting the untapped potential in their economic partnership.
Interestingly, India's exports to New Zealand reported a 1.74% fall and imports registered a 29.86% fall in FY24, according to data from the commerce ministry.

New Zealand aims to deepen its trade ties with India by focusing on dairy, food processing and technology, while India seeks broader market access for its agricultural products, textiles, and IT services.
India has signed FTAs with several countries and entities, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in the past few years to increase trade, investment and economic cooperation. The country is also negotiating FTAs with Oman, ASEAN and the European Union, among others.

"Indias farm exports may withstand US tariffs as competitors face steeper duties, says economist",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-farm-exports-may-withstand-us-tariffs-as-competitors-face-steeper-duties-says-economist-11743648571049.html,"New Delhi, Apr 3 (PTI) India could maintain or even expand its agricultural exports to the United States despite newly announced tariffs, as competing nations face even steeper duties, agricultural economist Ashok Gulati said on Thursday.
US President Donald Trump has announced reciprocal tariffs on countries across the board, declaring a 26 per cent ""discounted reciprocal tariff"" on India.
Trump's 26 per cent tariff on Indian goods would have a limited impact on key agricultural exports like seafood and rice when compared to higher duties imposed on regional competitors, Gulati said.
""We should not look at the tariff increase in absolute terms, but see relative tariff increases with our competitors,"" Gulati told PTI.
The former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) noted that while India faces 26 per cent tariffs, China faces 34 per cent, creating an 8 per cent differential advantage for Indian exporters.
Other competitors face even steeper barriers, with Vietnam at 46 per cent, Bangladesh at 37 per cent, Thailand at 36 per cent, and Indonesia at 32 per cent, Gulati said.
For seafood exports, particularly shrimp, Gulati explained that India's relative tariff advantage combined with shrimp's small share in overall US food expenditure means demand is unlikely to shrink significantly.
Similarly for rice exports, where current US tariffs range between 9 and 11 per cent, India maintains a competitive edge against Vietnam and Thailand despite the increase to 26 per cent.
Gulati, currently chair professor for agriculture at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), suggested India could potentially gain market share in spaces vacated by higher-taxed competitors.

"RBI to slash benchmark repo rates by 75 bps in 2025; 25 bps reduction each in April, June, October MPCs: SBI Report",https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-to-slash-benchmark-repo-rates-by-75-bps-in-2025-25-bps-reduction-each-in-april-june-october-mpcs-sbi-report-11741956448470.html,"TheReserve Bank of India (RBI)will likely slash the benchmark repo rate by a total of 75 basis points (bps) in 2025, with upcoming 25 bps reductions each in April, June, and October policy meetings. According to State Bank of India (SBI) Research Ecowrap, experts believeIndia's consumer price index (CPI)-based inflationwill be 3.9 per cent in the fourth quarter (January-March) of FY25 and average at around 4.7 per cent for the entire year.
However, looking ahead to FY26, inflation is expected to remain between 4.0 per cent and 4.2 per cent, with core inflation ranging from 4.2 per cent to 4.4 per cent. Given this trend, SBI research analysts anticipate a 75-basis-point rate cut during this cycle, with back-to-back reductions expected in April and June 2025. Another round of rate cuts could follow in October 2025.

""With benign inflation this month and going forward, we expect a cumulative rate cut over the cycle could be at least 75 basis points, with successive rate cuts in the next policy, April and June. With an intervening gap in Aug'25, the rate cuts cycle could restart from Oct'25, said SBI Research Ecowrap.
India's CPI inflation dropped to a seven-month low of 3.6 per cent in February 2025, mainly due to a sharp decline in food prices. The food and beverages inflation eased to 3.84 per cent as vegetable prices dropped significantly.Vegetable inflation turned negative for the first time in 20 months, led by major price drops in garlic, potatoes, and tomatoes.
Experts believe the MahaKumbh festival reduced garlic consumption, while fruit prices surged due to increased demand during fasting periods. Despite the inflation slowdown, imported inflation is rising, jumping from 1.3 per cent in June 2024 to 31.1 per cent in February 2025.

Higher prices for precious metals, oils, and chemical products drive this increase. Therupee's depreciationcould further impact inflation in the coming months. Meanwhile, India's industrial production (IIP) posted strong growth of 5 per cent in January 2025, up from 3.2 per cent in December 2024.
The manufacturing sector led the way with a 5.5 per cent increase, while mining grew by 4.4 per cent. However, cumulative growth from April 2024 to January 2025 stood at 4.2 per cent, lower than the six per cent recorded in the same period last year.
""The corporate sector showed resilience in economic fluctuations. Around 4,000 listed companies reported revenue growth of 6.2 per cent in Q3 FY25, with EBITDA rising by 11 per cent and profit after tax increasing by 12 per cent compared to the previous year,"" said SBI Research Ecowrap.

Sectors such as Capital Goods, Consumer Durables, FMCG, Healthcare, and Pharmaceuticals posted growth. SBI added that with lower inflation, an expected rate cut, and strong corporate performance, India's economy appears stable. However, rising imported inflation and global economic uncertainties remain key factors to watch in the coming months.

India’s services sector grows faster in February amid rising demand,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-services-sector-grows-faster-in-february-amid-rising-demand-11741153641932.html,"New Delhi [India], March 5 (ANI): The HSBC India Services PMI rose to 59.0 in February, up from January's 26-month low of 56.5, indicating a sharp expansion in business activity.
India's services sector expanded at a stronger pace in February, driven by rising domestic and international demand, leading to increased new orders, higher employment, and robust business activity. However, while cost pressures persisted, inflation rates eased to a four-month low, according to HSBC India Services PMI.
This growth was well above the long-run average, supported by higher productivity, strong demand, and an increase in new business orders.
New orders in February grew at a faster pace as compared to January, with improved international demand. Service providers reported stronger exports from clients across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East, meeting the rising demand and easing capacity pressures.
Services firms continued hiring at one of the fastest rates since data collection began in December 2005. Both full-time and part-time staff were recruited, showing the sector's confidence in sustained growth.
Despite rising hiring costs and higher expenses on food, materials, and packaging, overall cost inflation dropped to a four-month low, aligning with historical trends.
The rate of increase in selling prices for goods and services was the highest in three months, as businesses passed additional costs onto customers.
The HSBC India Composite Output Index, which measures both manufacturing and services, rose from 57.7 in January to 58.8 in February, reflecting stronger private sector growth. However, while the service sector drove this acceleration, manufacturing growth slowed down.
The private sector also saw a faster rise in employment, with payroll expansion remaining strong compared to the previous month's record growth.
However, backlogs of work continued to rise, suggesting that despite hiring efforts, demand remained higher than companies' processing capacities. New export business index, played a major role in driving output growth for India's services sector.""
Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC, said, ""India's services business activity index rose to 59.0 in February 2025, up considerably from January's 26-month low of 56.5. Global demand, which grew at its fastest pace in six months according to the new export business index, played a major role in driving output growth for India's services sector.""
Bhandari added, ""Meanwhile, job creation and charge inflation remained strong during February. Looking ahead, business sentiment remains broadly positive, but did slightly slip last month to its lowest level since August 2024.""
Advertising, improved customer relations, and efficiency gains kept business confidence broadly positive, with about one-quarter of firms expecting growth over the next year. However, sentiment dipped to a six-month low due to concerns over cost pressures and future demand.
Among the four key service industry segments, Consumer Services saw the highest cost pressures, while Transport, Information & Communication firms recorded the strongest rise in selling prices. (ANI)

Bengaluru pubs may stay open till 1 am | Karnataka’s Happy Nightlife push to boost revenue from India’s Silicon Valley,https://www.livemint.com/economy/bengaluru-pubs-may-get-extended-hours-until-1-am-as-karnataka-state-revenue-boost-nightlife-push-dk-shivakumar-details-11742546328836.html,"TheKarnatakastate government is likely to pass a proposal allowing standalone pubs in the capital city of Bengaluru to operate until 1 am daily, according to a News18 report.
The development is expected to get the nod after the state government recently relaxed rules to allow licensed establishments such as bars, hotels, and restaurants to operate until 1 am, it added.
The report noted that at present, standalone pubs have to adhere to a strict 11.30 pm closing time, which is enforced by the police. An extension would allow them to operate at par with similarly licensed businesses.
Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister andBengaluruUrban in-charge minister DK Shivakumar hinted at this in the state legislative council in response to a question raised by BJP MLC Gopinath Reddy. Reddy inquired about the Karnataka state Excise Department's regulations on standalone pubs.
The report added that he assured the floor that he, state Excise Minister RB Timmapur, and state Home Minister G Parameshwara would “seriously examine” the merits of the time extension proposal.
Shivakumaragreed that the current 11.30 pm deadline is being used as a “harassment technique” by law enforcement agencies, and added: “As Bengaluru’s minister, I agree that the city needs a lively nightlife. This is the hub of techies and IT-BT professionals working late into the night, and they need a space to unwind.”
Overall, the relaxations aim to boost the nightlife culture in India's start-up and tech hub, and improve government revenue from such businesses, the report noted.

"Marathwada region reports 3,090 farmer suicide cases in last 3 calendar years: Govt",https://www.livemint.com/economy/marathwada-region-reports-3-090-farmer-suicide-cases-in-last-3-calendar-years-govt-11743166706540.html,"New Delhi, Mar 28 (PTI) As many as 3,090 cases of farmers' suicides have been reported in the Marathwada region during the last three calendar years, the government informed Parliament on Friday.
In a written reply to Rajya Sabha, Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the Home Ministry compiles and disseminates information on suicides in its publication titled ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India’ (ADSI). The state-wise report till 2022 is available on the NCRB website.
The minister informed that ""farmers' suicides during the last three years in the Marathwada region"" stood at 3,090. Total number of cases stood at 1,022 in the 2022 calendar year, 1,116 cases in 2023 and 952 cases in 2024, as per the information shared by the Divisional Commissioner Office (Revenue Department), Chh. Sambhajinagar.
""The ADSI Report does not specify separate reasons for farmers’ suicide. However, the ADSI Report mentions various reasons of suicides (without any reference to farmers) i.e. family problems, illness, drug abuse, alcoholic addiction, marriage-related issues, love affairs, bankruptcy or indebtedness, unemployment, failure in examination, profession/ career problem and poverty,"" Chouhan said.
To enhance farmers' income, the minister said the Centre supplements the efforts of States through appropriate policy measures, budgetary support and various schemes/ programmes.
In 2013-14, the budget allocation of Ministry of Cooperation, Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, and Department of Fisheries, which were integral parts of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, was only₹30,223.88 crore. The budget of these ministries in 2024-25 was₹2,67,721.57 crore, he said.

"South Korea’s Marriages Jump, Offering Hopes for Aging Nation",https://www.livemint.com/economy/south-korea-s-marriages-jump-offering-hopes-for-aging-nation-11742440952610.html,"South Korean marriages increased the most on record in a hopeful sign for a nation that has been ramping up efforts to boost the world’s lowest fertility rate behind growing economic pessimism.
More than 222,000 couples tied the knot in 2024 in a 14.8% jump from a year earlier, marking an acceleration from a 1% rise a year earlier, according to data released Thursday from the national statistics office. That’s the biggest increase in data going back to 1990.
The figure comes a month after South Korea reported its fertility rate increased for the first time in nine years in 2024. The rise in fertility and marriages may be led by people born in the early 1990s, a period when the nation saw a bump in the number of births, and by couples who postponed weddings during the pandemic.
Years of spending by the government to encourage more people to get married may have also contributed. Supportive schemes have included greater compensation for parental leaves and a reduction in mortgage interest-rates for families that have newborns. Seoul, the nation’s capital, came up with plans to offer financial support to residents seeking to reverse vasectomies or tubectomies.
A dearth of babies is a major cause of aging in South Korea, generating concerns about the growing fiscal burdens of public pensions and health care. Its shrinking workforce also adds to challenges with fewer people able to help drive innovation in a country that faces mounting competition from China and other emerging rivals in everything from manufacturing to technology.
The number of babies expected per woman in a lifetime stands at 0.75 as of last year, which is the world’s lowest even though it picked up from 0.72 in 2023. Among major cities, Seoul had the lowest fertility rate at 0.58.
Several factors have been blamed for the reluctance among South Koreans to have babies, including high costs of living and a paucity of affordable housing. Parents also fear unfavorable consequences after returning to offices from childcare leave. They also face expenses for education that proportionately rank among the highest in the developed world.
The link between marriages and births remains strong in South Korea where births out of wedlock are uncommon. The age at which men get married for the first time stood at 33.9 while it was 31.6 for women last year, the data said. Demographic research indicates the earlier a couple gets married, the more likely they are to have multiple children.

German Public-Sector Workers May Get Staggered Wage Increase,https://www.livemint.com/economy/german-public-sector-workers-may-get-staggered-wage-increase-11743178090011.html,"(Bloomberg) -- German public-sector workers may get a pay rise in two stages if they accept a proposal from an arbitration commission that was installed when three rounds of talks with employers failed to produce a result.
Under the compromise solution unveiled Friday, staff would receive a 3% salary increase in April and another 2.8% rise in May 2026. Unions had sought an 8% rise over 12 months for about 2.5 million employees in areas as varied as waste management, social services, public transport and health care.
“In view of the very wide gap between the positions of the collective-bargaining parties, a compromise was challenging for both sides,” said Roland Koch, who negotiated the possible solution on behalf of employers. Both sides had to make “considerable concessions,” he said.
Wage growth is a key focus for the European Central Bank as it ponders how much further it can cut interest rates. While inflation is approaching the 2% target, price growth in the services sector remains more stubborn — largely because past salary boosts continue to reverberate through the economy.
The ECB has argued that this dynamic will end as wages catch up with the recent years’ inflation. But a persistently tighter labor market, driven by an aging population, has stoked concerns that workers will be in a better position to seek stronger pay rises than in the past. An annual 3% increase is generally seen in line with the inflation goal.
“In the current social situation, concluding collective agreements is a complicated and challenging process,” said Henning Luehr, who negotiated on behalf of employees.
Apart from higher pay, workers had also sought more flexible working hours to improve conditions and attract people to the public sector. The current workload in many professions — exacerbated by widespread staff shortages — makes it hard to retain employees, Verdi has argued. Tens of thousands participated in strikes in recent weeks, shutting down air travel and leaving trash uncollected.
Under the proposed compromise, workers will receive a higher annual bonus from next year, which they can exchange for days off. A final round of talks to discuss these points is scheduled for April 5.

"Japan’s real wages drop in January, spring wage talks in focus",https://www.livemint.com/economy/japans-real-wages-drop-in-january-spring-wage-talks-in-focus-11741563127393.html,"*
Japan Jan real wages -1.8% year/year vs revised 0.3% in Dec
*
Two-year high inflation drags real pay down despite solid nominal growth
*
Labour unions demand highest pay hike in more than 30 years
By Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO, - Japan's real wages fell in January after two months of slight gains, data showed on Monday, days before the annual rounds of pay negotiations held each spring culminate at the country's major firms. Despite regular pay rising the most in more than 30 years and overtime pay increasing, lifting nominal wages, inflation at a two-year high dragged down real wages - the indicator policymakers see as key to achieving consumption-driven economic growth. The Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at its next policy review on March 18-19, as officials repeatedly cite the need to gauge the sustainability of wage growth after the central bank's January rate hike.
Inflation-adjusted real wages, which determine consumers' purchasing power, dropped 1.8% in January from a year earlier, labour ministry data showed. The decline followed a revised 0.3% rise in December and 0.5% gain in November. The consumer inflation rate the ministry uses to calculate real wages, which includes fresh food items but not rent costs, rose to 4.7% year-on-year - the highest reading since January 2023.
Regular pay, or base salary, rose 3.1% in January following December's revised 2.6% increase and marking the biggest jump since 1992, the data showed.
Overtime pay, a barometer of corporate activity strength, also jumped 3.1%, after a revised 0.8% gain in December.
Special payments, mainly made up of volatile one-off bonuses, were down 3.7%. Total cash earnings, or nominal pay, rose 2.8% to 295,505 yen on average, slowing from December's revised 4.4% rise, due largely to the drop in special payments. Japan's largest labour group last week said its member unions were demanding an average 6.09% pay hike, their boldest claim in more than 30 years.
In Japan, annual wage talks between management and labour unions conclude around mid-March among major firms, setting a standard for the salary negotiations of non-unionised workers and smaller enterprises.
The effect of these annual spring talks typically begins to show up in wage statistics for April or later, according to a labour ministry official.

"Revised investment, turnover criteria from Apr 1 to help MSMEs scale up, boost job creation:Experts",https://www.livemint.com/economy/revised-investment-turnover-criteria-from-apr-1-to-help-msmes-scale-up-boost-job-creationexperts-11743423135430.html,"New Delhi, Mar 31 (PTI) The revised investment and turnover criteria for micro, small and medium enterprises, effective from Tuesday this week, is expected to offer greater opportunities for growth and expansion, resulting in increased job creation, according to experts.
The government has notified significant revisions to the turnover and investment criteria for classifying MSMEs, which will come into effect from April 1.
Under the revised criteria, the investment and turnover limits for classification of all MSMEs will be enhanced to 2.5 and 2 times, respectively.
""The revised and increased eligibility should enable those MSMEs who have had good growth to grow further by giving them increased headroom to continue to grow. It should be especially beneficial for new micro enterprises as they can scale up with the various fiscal incentives available, especially with regard to access to finance,"" Ashok Saigal, Co-Chairman of CII National MSME Council, told PTI.
He further said the growth of MSMEs is expected to boost employment creation.
Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with investments up to₹2.5 crore will now be classified as micro enterprises, from the previous threshold of₹1 crore. The turnover limit has been revised from₹5 crore to₹10 crore.
Units with investments up to₹25 crore will be classified as small enterprises, from the earlier₹10 crore. The turnover limit for such enterprises has been doubled from₹50 crore to₹100 crore.
MSMEs with investments up to₹125 crore will now be classified as medium enterprises, from the earlier limit of₹50 crore. For medium enterprises, the turnover limit has been doubled to₹500 crore.
During her budget speech, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced new classification criteria for MSMEs.
""To help them (MSMEs) achieve higher efficiencies of scale, technological upgradation and better access to capital, the investment and turnover limits for classification of all MSMEs will be enhanced to 2.5 and 2 times, respectively. This will give them the confidence to grow and generate employment for our youth,"" the Finance Minister said in her Budget speech on February 1.

Singapore Warns of Tariff Cascade as Worried Asia Eyes Trump,https://www.livemint.com/economy/singapore-warns-of-tariff-cascade-as-worried-asia-eyes-trump-11741747962102.html,"Singapore’s top trade official warned that a barrage of actions from the US and other countries risks undermining global economic growth, in some of the strongest public comments underscoring concerns in the trade-reliant nation.
“Many of us here in Asia watch with anxiety President Donald Trump’s tariffs on the US’ three largest trading partners, and his plans for more,” Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong said Wednesday at CNBC’s Converge Live in Singapore. Even if not all of Asia is directly affected, the impact of rising tariffs and trade wars could cause major disruptions to supply chains and slow trade and investment flows, he said.
That would “significantly set back the growth of the global economy,” said Gan, who is also minister for trade and industry.
Singapore built much of its success on having an open economy and strategically located port, and remains a key exporter of higher-value-added goods including electronics and pharmaceuticals. But along with other trade-dependent nations, it has closely tracked the US president as he unleashes tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, rattling markets and drawing retaliation from Ottawa and Beijing.
A sweeping 25% US tariff on steel and aluminum imports to America is set to take effect Wednesday. Other countries have also followed in Washington’s footsteps, imposing trade restrictions on or looking into China’s steel exports.

Singapore has previously signaled its concerns at the global developments. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong described a “fragmented and troubled world” and “turbulent external environment” in his budget speech last month.
“New walls are being erected – not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers,” Wong said on Feb. 18.
And Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen last month said that Asian perspectives of the US have shifted dramatically.
“The image has changed from liberator to great disruptor to a landlord seeking rent,” he said at a round-table discussion at the Munich Security Conference, according to a text of his remarks posted on a government website.

But Gan did sound an optimistic note on Asia, projecting it to expand from just under 50% of the global economy today to around 60% by 2030. He cited young and growing populations in countries including Indonesia, India and Vietnam, along with a rising middle class and good physical and digital connectivity.
To realize its potential, Asia needs to remain open for trade, talent and investment, he said, advocating the continued removal of barriers through the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement. ASEAN will also progressively update its deals with the six “ASEAN-plus” partners including Australia, China, India and New Zealand, Gan said.

Trump’s reciprocal tariff to hurt India’s gems and jewellery sector; exporters to be hit,https://www.livemint.com/economy/trump-reciprocal-tariff-us-india-gems-and-jewellery-exports-goldiam-international-vaibhav-global-11743653585009.html,"The US government's decision to impose a 27% additional reciprocal tariff on Indian imports is expected to significantly impact India's gems and jewellery sector, experts said. Gems and jewellery made up 12.8% of India's exports to the US and amounted to $9.9 billion in FY24.
US President Donald Trump announced the new tariff on 2 April, which he said is about half the rate of India's 54% tariff on US imports. The current US duty for Indian gold jewellery imports is 5%, per a note from EY, and there are no duties on import of cut and polished diamonds.
Garments, engineering goods, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and gems and jewellery accounted for 72.7% of the total goods trade between India and the US in FY24, contributing $56.34 billion out of the overall trade of $77.52 billion.
“The [gems and jewellery] trade is expected to come at a standstill as US importers will assess whether to place orders with Indian jewellery exporters,” said Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council.
He added that while gold and diamond jewellery are considered a luxury in the US, they are viewed as an investment in India. Therefore, if prices rise, demand in the US is likely to decline.
Experts said diamond and studded-gold jewellery exporters will be the most impacted by the US tariffs.
For starters, the additional 27% duty will be a challenge for the importer in the US to bear, leading to lower exports from India, said Anup Zaveri, a partner at Real Illusion LLP, a diamond manufacturer. He added that exporters will need to gauge the duty on specific items such as loose diamonds and gold-studded items.
Cut and polished diamonds accounted for 57% of India’s total gems and jewellery exports to the US in FY24, making them the largest contributor, according to a report by Emkay Institutional Equities on 26 March.
Studded-gold jewellery comprised 27% of these exports. The remaining share came from silver jewellery, lab-grown diamonds, and plain gold jewellery, which had a comparatively lower contribution.
The tariffs are expected to hit major exporters including Goldiam International, Vaibhav Global and Rajesh Exports. However, companies with a lower dependence on US exports such as Kalyan Jewellers and Titan are likely to be less affected.
“Sentimentally, the tariff on gems and jewellery will be negative for jewellery exporters as demand for gold jewellery is likely to get impacted,” said Preeyam Toila, equity research analyst, FMCG and retail, at Axis Securities. “Moreover, from the domestic perspective, surging gold prices due to global uncertainty will have near-term pressure on domestic demand.”
Goldiam International shares fell as much as 10% on the BSE on Thursday, while Vaibhav Global declined more than 4%. Rajesh Exports declined 3.2% before recovering.
Trump said on April 2 that sectors such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, copper, lumber articles, gold, energy and minerals will be spared reciprocal tariffs. Also, sector-specific tariffs will be imposed later.

"India’s Top Banker Must Ease Credit, But Not Too Much",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-top-banker-must-ease-credit-but-not-too-much-11741296120183.html,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Sanjay Malhotra, the new Reserve Bank of India governor, is right to unwind some of his predecessor’s hawkish controls on a runaway consumer-credit boom. There was a time to throw sand in the wheels of commerce. Right now, though, a sputtering growth engine needs lubrication.
Still, Malhotra must be cautious. There is a crack in the structure of the world’s fastest-growing major economy. Speeding up subprime loans could be risky down the road.
Effective April 1, banks will set aside less capital on loans to better-rated nonbanking financial companies. The monetary authority has also lowered the risk weights on microfinance loans for consumer credit to 100%, restoring them to their pre-November-2023 levels. Back then, Shaktikanta Das, the former RBI chief, had raised the weights to 125%.
The capital thus freed up could fuel banks’ own lending. The sharp downtrend in their advances to shadow lenders — who ultimately serve less creditworthy borrowers — should also reverse.
Both of those outcomes will be timely. Gross domestic product may have grown 6.5% in the year that ends March 31, according to the government’s estimates, slowing from 9.2% in the previous 12 months. The next year’s forecast doesn’t herald much of a pickup, either.
And those official statistics may not be capturing the full extent of the funk in consumer demand in urban areas where wages are stagnant, and jobs are under threat from artificial intelligence. Amid a $900 billion rout in the stock market, and with US President Donald Trump’s trade war creating uncertainty for output, prices and interest rates globally, it’s understandable that policymakers want credit to flow more easily.
Yet Malhotra must know that his recent move is just a temporary solution. The 8% GDP growth that authorities say they want to sustain — to propel a lower-middle-income economy to a developed one — will need a more concrete foundation than a hole filled with consumer credit.
Eight years ago, banks and finance companies gave out 2.5 million advances of less than 100,000 rupees ($1,150). Last year, there were 122 million of such small-ticket loans, accounting for 88% of all personal credit origination, according to Blume Ventures, a Mumbai-based early stage venture-capital investor that releases a popular annual report. Thanks to rapid digitization, which has quickened credit checks and approvals, finance companies and banks were able to push out $100 billion in new personal loans out the door in 2024, a six-fold jump from 2017.
That’s a big addition to household liabilities in a short time. Where’s the appetite for this borrowing coming from?
The Blume report offers clues. The richest 30 million households in the most-populous nation have an aggregate purchasing power similar to Mexico’s. Their consumption is powering the economy. The next 70 million, earning about $3,000 per capita annually, are on their way to rivaling Indonesia’s living standards. They are trying to mimic the spending choices of the top earners who are five times richer, on average.
The remaining 200 million families — 1 billion people — are India’s equivalent of sub-Saharan Africa, dipping into savings to survive. They have no money for discretionary expenditure.
The research doesn’t say it, but my guess is that “India 1,” as the authors term the top consuming class, is financing both the aspirations of “India 2,” and the desperation of “India 3.” The interest payments on the borrowings by the latter two groups is flowing to the first, making it wealthier still. And therein lies the structural flaw in the economy.
A 2021 paper by economists at Princeton, Harvard and the University of Chicago argues that instead of productive investment, the “saving glut of the rich” Americans — accumulating over four decades — drove “dissaving by the non-rich and dissaving by the government.”
It’s possible that something similar is afoot half a world away. Income and wealth distribution in the fifth-largest economy is now more unequal than it was a hundred years ago under the British Raj. That would explain the surge in small-ticket personal loans. It would also explain why a middle class stuck in a cycle of mediocre work, poor pay and heavy indirect taxes lost billions of dollars trading options, enriching the likes of Jane Street Group. The derivatives market witnessed a 40-fold jump since 2019 before regulators stepped in to stop the madness.
New Delhi, too, has become dependent — not only on the savings glut of the local wealthy, but of rich investors globally. Without the $12 billion it earned from a long-term capital gains tax that even foreigners have to pay, the government’s effective revenue deficit would have been 13% higher in 2022-23. But when that fickle source of tax income comes up short, the axe of deficit reduction may fall on welfare programs. Which would leave poor households more reliant on small-ticket loans that groups of women borrowers can obtain from microfinance firms.
That’s the business model of microfinance in India, and it has a crisis once every few years. A recently released report by a government think tank shows a 42%, one-year jump in the number of women borrowers actively monitoring their credit. Much of it may be anxiety about default, passing off as empowerment. While lowering the risk weight on consumer credit via microfinance, the Reserve Bank will hopefully remain alive to the risk.
While he can’t do much about jobs or wages, Malhotra could tell his bosses in New Delhi to stop dreaming about a developed society until they have fixed the corrosive inequality hollowing out the economy’s foundation. The rest is up to them.

India may soon slash EV import tariffs as Donald Trump seeks to impose levies — Here’s what we know,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-may-soon-slash-ev-import-tariffs-as-donald-trump-seeks-to-impose-levies-heres-what-we-know-11743608651377.html,"India is planning to slash import duties on electric vehicles even as it rejects requests from domestic EV makers to delay such moves by four years. This comes as New Delhi plans to close a trade deal with Washington DC.
According to a Reuters report quoting sources familiar with the development, India is serious about cuttingEV tariffs. This comes despite automakers supporting the Modi government to delay any cut in EV tariffs until 2029.
But India is prioritising the EV tariff cuts over domestic carmaker demands, with the levies riling US President Donald Trump and his billionaire Tesla CEO ally Elon Musk.
According to the report quoting two government officials, electric vehicle industry is set to be part of the first tranche of tariff reductions in a planned bilateral trade deal.
“We have protected the auto industry for far too long. We will have to open it up,” one of the government officials told Reuters. The source further revealed that EV tariffs will be cut ‘significantly’ among other products.
The officials did not elaborate or disclose the size of the plannedduty cutgiven ongoing negotiations with Washington.
New Delhi's plan to cut duties on EVs and other goods comes as it seeks to build bridges with Trump - who has referred to India as a ""tariff king"" - even as he prepares to announce reciprocal tariffs on trading partners later on Wednesday.
An immediate cut would be a victory for Tesla, which has finalised showrooms in Mumbai and New Delhi to begin selling imported cars in the South Asian nation this year. Trump has said it is currently ""impossible"" for Tesla to sell in India and it would be unfair if it had to build a factory there.
But it would be a setback for domestic players likeTata Motorsand Mahindra & Mahindra, which have invested millions of dollars in local EV manufacturing, with more to come, and lobbied against duty cuts.
Automakers fear any agreement with the U.S. would set a precedent for ongoing trade talks with the European Union and Britain, intensifying competition in India's small but fast growing EV sector, three of the sources said.

"Govts capex focus shifts from roads to water, sanitation, and digital infra: Elara Report",https://www.livemint.com/economy/govts-capex-focus-shifts-from-roads-to-water-sanitation-and-digital-infra-elara-report-11743132514854.html,"New Delhi [India], March 28 (ANI): The government is shifting its capital expenditure (capex) priorities from traditional sectors like roads to areas such as water supply, sanitation, digital infrastructure, urban development, and irrigation, according to a report by Elara Securities.
The report, which analyzed 18 state budgets announced so far, also indicated that the growth of capital outlay is expected to slow down to 15.9 per cent year-on-year (YoY) in the Budget Estimates (BE) for FY26. This is a moderation compared to the average growth of 23.4 per cent in the past two years. A similar trend was also observed in the Union Budget for FY26, which suggested a slower pace of capex growth.
It said, ""Increased focus on sectors such as Water Supply and Irrigation away from Roads indicates a shift in government priority.""
The report stated that the budget allocation for transport is projected to grow by just 3.2 per cent YoY in FY26BE, a sharp decline from the 18.3 per cent average growth recorded in the past four years.
Meanwhile, allocations for water supply and sanitation are set to rise by 33.54 per cent YoY, while irrigation will see a 19.56 per cent increase. This is a notable jump from the growth rates of 8.03 per cent and -1.32 per cent YoY, respectively, in the Revised Estimates (RE) for FY25.
Despite the shift in spending priorities, the capital outlay as a percentage of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) has remained stable at 2.8 per cent in FY26BE, slightly higher than 2.7 per cent in FY25RE. However, spending remains a challenge, with only 54.3 per cent of the revised estimates for FY25 spent by January of this financial year.
This raises concerns about whether the full target will be met. Historically, there has been an average deviation of 13.5 per cent between revised estimates and actual spending, with a shortfall of 14 per cent recorded in FY24.
The report suggested that this shift in capex focus will create new opportunities for diversified infrastructure companies. Increased investments in water supply, sanitation, digital infrastructure, urban development, and irrigation are expected to drive fresh order inflows for companies operating in these sectors. (ANI)

On Friday, the US Senate is set to vote on a Republican budget proposal, marking the next step in a multi-phase effort to extend tax cuts that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Lawmakers still face tough choices, including deciding which spending programs to reduce and which tax cuts to prioritise, as reported byBloomberg.
Earlier that day, President Trump criticised China for imposing a 34% tariff on all American goods in retaliation for his own tariffs, which increased duties on Chinese imports to at least 54%. This tit-for-tat escalation raised concerns that the trade conflict could intensify and push global economies toward a recession.

US stocks suffered another sharp decline on Friday, with the S&P 500 Index falling 6%. This marked the steepest two-day drop since the pandemic began in March 2020, erasing around $5 trillion in market value.
Despite the market turmoil, the president seemed undeterred, buoyed by March jobs data that exceeded expectations. U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 228,000 last month, reflecting hiring decisions made before he unveiled his tariff strategy.

“GREAT JOB NUMBERS, FAR BETTER THAN EXPECTED. IT’S ALREADY WORKING,” the president wrote in another social media post earlier Friday.
Complicating the challenge for foreign leaders and business executives are Trump’s own mixed signals about his willingness to negotiate to reduce the size and scope of his levies. Late Thursday, Trump indicated he would be willing to lower his duties if other nations offered him something “phenomenal.”

Trump and his top advisers believe that tariffs—especially a minimum 10% tax on all US trading partners—will drive domestic investment as companies seek to avoid import duties. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro explained in a Thursday CNBC interview that granting exemptions could weaken this incentive for businesses to invest in U.S. manufacturing.
Separately, Trump shared a TikTok video from another user claiming he was deliberately causing a 20% market crash as part of a broader strategy to pressure the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates. The video argued that the tariffs would push companies to invest more in the U.S. and encourage farmers to sell more products domestically, ultimately lowering grocery prices.

India’s Threadbare Utilities Are Threatening a Green Energy Boom,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-threadbare-utilities-are-threatening-a-green-energy-boom-11741139423015.html,"(Bloomberg) -- A green energy auction system that has turbocharged India’s solar and wind growth is at risk of being upended by the country’s cash-strapped utilities.
Eager to save on intermediary costs and to keep electricity charges down, power distributors are beginning to plan their own, alternative, renewable-energy auctions, according to central government and regional energy officials. If these gain traction, they could replace the current system, where four government agencies act as guarantors to ensure the power projects are viable — but also collect a fee in return.
Analysts fear the result of an effort to press for short-term savings would leave renewable projects dependent on India’s threadbare power distributors. That would threaten the development of hundreds of gigawatts of projects, and India’s green targets.
“This model has been a catalyst in attracting private investments in the renewables sector,” said Girishkumar Kadam, a credit analyst at ICRA Ltd., which rates Solar Energy Corp. of India, or Seci, one of the state agencies. “The response wouldn’t have been similar if the weak state utilities floated their own tenders.”
India, the world’s third-biggest emitter, wants to more than double clean power capacity to 500 gigawatts by 2030. The federal auction model has been instrumental in helping the country add more than 130 gigawatts of renewables projects over the past decade.
In a typical auction, the agency signs two separate contracts. The first is a power-purchase agreement with the supplier, ensuring them timely offtake and payments, and then a power-sale agreement with provincial retailers — a structure that has been effective in getting around unreliable local players
To underwrite the risks, the four agencies — NTPC Ltd., SJVN Ltd., NHPC Ltd. and Solar Energy Corp. of India or Seci — charge a fixed fee of 0.07 rupees on every kilowatt hour of electricity sold from the projects. Almost 80% of India’s solar and wind power capacity was added since this system was introduced in 2015.
But roughly a decade since the first auctions took place, some of these beneficiaries are demanding the fee for the intermediaries be reduced to bring down the cost of power — even as, according to Raj Kumar Chaudhary, who heads two of the four federal firms, auctioning agencies have resisted.
Utilities are now reluctant to sign binding contracts with auctioned projects, holding up production. Nearly 35 gigawatts of supply is waiting to sign long-term offtake agreements, a number that has been rising over the months, according to data from Solar Energy Corp. of India.
ICRA’s Kadam said the utilities have benefited from the “competitive bidding and robust price discovery” in federal auctions and said the developers’ participation would be selective in state tenders. State power retailers together accounted for accumulated losses of $80 billion as of March 2024.
“The government is aware of the issue and the matter is under review,” India’s renewable energy ministry said in response to questions from Bloomberg.
Seci said it has submitted its views to the government and declined to comment further. NTPC didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.
“It’s already a meager margin; if that too is pruned, the business will no longer be viable,” Chaudhary, chairman of NHPC and SJVN, said in an interview. “The risks would outweigh gains.”

Cement prices are likely to increase because of new mineral tax by states: Report,https://www.livemint.com/economy/cement-prices-are-likely-to-increase-because-of-new-mineral-tax-by-states-report-11742017044092.html,"Chennai (Tamil Nadu) [India], March 15 (ANI): Cement prices across various states are likely to increase as state governments may impose new mineral taxes after a Supreme Court judgement, according to JM Financial report.
Following the Supreme Court ruling in July 2024, which allowed states to levy taxes on mineral rights and mineral-bearing lands in addition to royalties, Tamil Nadu has introduced the Tamil Nadu Mineral Bearing Land Tax Act, 2024.
Under this law, an additional Rs160 per tonne tax on limestone mining will take effect from February 20, 2025. With other mineral-rich states, including Karnataka, considering similar measures, cement companies are expected to raise prices to offset rising costs.
The new tax is expected to significantly impact cement manufacturers operating in Tamil Nadu. As limestone is a key raw material in cement production, the additional tax will increase the cost of manufacturing, forcing companies to consider price hikes to maintain profitability.
To offset the cost impact, cement prices in Tamil Nadu are expected to rise by Rs8-10 per bag. Over the past few years, cement prices in the state have been under pressure due to intense market competition.
However, with this new tax burden, companies may have no choice but to pass on the additional cost to consumers through price increases. Industry experts believe that Tamil Nadu's move may set a precedent for other mineral-rich states to introduce similar taxes.
The Karnataka government is already in discussions regarding a potential mineral tax, and other states with significant limestone reserves may follow suit. If more states impose such levies, cement prices across India could witness a broader increase in the coming months.
Cement companies are expected to adopt a gradual approach to price hikes to avoid sudden shocks in the market. However, with rising input costs, the industry's pricing strategy will be a key factor to watch in the near future.
As the situation unfolds, analysts will closely monitor how cement manufacturers adjust their pricing and how the new tax policy influences the broader construction and real estate sectors in Tamil Nadu and beyond. (ANI)

Trump downplays business concerns about uncertainty from his tariffs and prospect of higher prices,https://www.livemint.com/economy/trump-downplays-business-concerns-about-uncertainty-from-his-tariffs-and-prospect-of-higher-prices-11741535752063.html,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Donald Trump is dismissing business concerns over the uncertainty caused by his planned tariffs on a range of American trading partners and the prospect of higher prices, and isn't ruling out the possibility of a recession this year.
After imposing and then quickly pausing 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada that sent markets tumbling over concerns of a trade war, Trump said his plans for broader “reciprocal” tariffs will go into effect April 2, raising them to match what other countries assess.
“April 2nd, it becomes all reciprocal,” he said in a taped interview with Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.” “What they charge us, we charge them.”
Asked about the Atlanta Fed's warning of an economic contraction in the first quarter of the year, Trump seemingly acknowledged that his plans could affect U.S. growth. Still, he claimed, it would ultimately be “be great for us.”
“There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big,” Trump said. ""It takes a little time. It takes a little time.""
On Wall Street, it was a tough week with wild swings dominated by worries about the economy and uncertainty about what Trump's tariffs.
Trump brushed aside concerns from businesses seeking stability as they make investment decisions. He said that “for years the globalists, the big globalists have been ripping off the United States"" and that now, ""all we’re doing is getting some of it back, and we’re going to treat our country fairly.""
“You know, the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up and, you know, I don’t know if it’s predictability,” the Republican president said.
Trump last week lifted the Mexico and Canada tariffs on American car manufacturers, and then virtually all imports to the U.S., but kept them on goods from China.
More tariffs are coming this week, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling NBC's “Meet the Press” that 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will take effect Wednesday. Lutnick said Trump's threatened tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber though would wait until April.
“Will there be distortions? Of course,” Lutnick said. “Foreign goods may get a little more expensive. But American goods are going to get cheaper, and you’re going to be helping Americans by buying American.”

67 pc of outstanding direct tax demand difficult to collect: IT Dept to Par panel,https://www.livemint.com/economy/67-pc-of-outstanding-direct-tax-demand-difficult-to-collect-it-dept-to-par-panel-11742465302953.html,"New Delhi, Mar 20 (PTI) Two-third of₹43 lakh crore outstanding direct tax demand is ""difficult to collect"", Income Tax Department has informed a Parliamentary panel.
When the Standing Committee on Finance expressed concern over the huge arrears of demand and desired to know the possible steps, including a moratorium, that can be taken to address this, the Chairman of CBDT told the panel that arrears are a cause for concern.
""We have around₹43,00,000 crore of arrear demand which is a cause of concern for us. Partly, this is a legacy issue. This arrear pertains to mid-90s also because earlier what used to happen was there was essentially a manual registers that we were keeping,"" the CBDT Chairman told the panel.
The report of the Standing Committee on Finance has been tabled in Parliament.
The Revenue Secretary informed the panel that a lot of this demand is also ""fictitious"".
The Committee found that in respect of Direct Taxes,₹10,55,906 crore tax arrears are pending for five or more years.
""The Committee has been given to understand that some of the arrears date back even to the mid-1990s,"" the report said.
The panel also noted that as per tax authorities, out of₹43,07,201 crore arrears,₹28,95,851 crore which comes to 67 per cent, is difficult to collect. It also found that a lot of this demand arrear is also fictitious.
Before the digitisation of processes, a manual register system was in place, which did not account for interest.
However, the current system now calculates interest annually.
""Since income tax penalty is very heavy, every year of delay will keep on adding to the demand, which is in any case remains non-collectible. The Committee express their concern over the present scenario and believe that there is a pressing need to review the tax assessment system to make it more efficient in collection of taxes, keeping in view the ground realities,"" the report said.
The Committee was of the view that while genuine demands should be strictly collected, the tax authorities should also undertake a thorough introspection of the existing tax assessment system and remain sensitive to the hardships faced by honest taxpayers due to erroneous or inflated tax demands.
The Committee recommend that, since all the tax records have been digitised, it is ""high time to take decisive interventions"", including writing off demands/ imposing moratoriums, to reduce and trueing up the huge backlog of demand arrears in a time-bound manner, the report said.

DA Hike: Good news before Holi? 7th Pay Commission likely to grant 2% DA hike to employees and pensioners,https://www.livemint.com/economy/da-hike-good-news-before-holi-7th-pay-commission-likely-to-grant-2-da-hike-to-employees-and-pensioners-11741336744893.html,"The Central Government is likely to announce a dearness allowance (DA) and dearness relief (DR) hike of 2 per cent for its employees ahead of the festival of Holi (March 14, 2025), reported multiple media outlets.
According to aMoneycontrolreport, more than 12 million central government employees and pensioners are set to benefit from this salary hike under the7th Pay Commission, which was implemented on January 1, 2016.
As a result of this move, the employees'dearness allowanceis set to increase to 55 per cent from its current 53 per cent level of basic pay. However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to announce the final decision in the Union Cabinet.
The last dearness allowance hike was in October 2024. Central government employees received an increase of 3 per cent, bringing their DA to 53 per cent, compared to the previous level of 50 per cent of the basic pay. The hike came into effect on July 1, 2024, and was also applicable to pensioners, according to the report.
Dearness allowance is a segment of a central government employees' salary and dearness relief is granted to the pensioners.
Dearness Allowance is a salary component forcentral government employeeswhich the government pays them to help reduce the impact of the rising inflation in the economy, according to a Bajaj Finserv report.
According to the data, the increase in the dearness allowance for central government employees is calculated based on the percentage increase in 12 monthly averages of the All India Consumer Price Index (AICPI), i.e., the inflation indicator, for the period ending June 2022.
The central government revises the payout of the allowances every year in Janaury and June, but the announcement is followed in March and September, as per the news reports.
The percentage of the dearness allowance amount can be calculated in the following methods:
Dearness Allowance Percentage:((Average of All-India Consumer Price Index (Base Year 2001=100) for the past 12 months -115.76)/115.76) x 100.
For Central public sector employees:DA% = ((Average of All-India Consumer Price Index (Base Year 2001=100) for the past 3 months -126.33)/126.33) x 100.
The latestConsumer Price Indexfor Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) indicates that the DA for the central government employees is set to be increased by 2 per cent, effective from January 2025. The DA will increase to 55.98 per cent under the 7th Pay Commission.

US corporate profits surge in fourth quarter; tariff turbulence looms,https://www.livemint.com/economy/us-corporate-profits-surge-in-fourth-quarter-tariff-turbulence-looms-11743090150738.html,"*
Corporate profits rebound strongly in fourth quarter
*
Solid profit margins supporting labor market
*
Fourth-quarter GDP growth revised up to 2.4% rate
*
Weekly jobless claims slip 1,000 to 224,000
By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON, - U.S. corporate profits increased sharply in the fourth quarter, but an uncertain economic outlook due to tariffs is creating a challenging environment for businesses that economists say could force companies to lay off workers to protect margins.
The report from the Commerce Department on Thursday also showed the economy grew at a slightly more solid clip last quarter than previously estimated amid pre-emptive buying of big-ticket items like motor vehicles ahead of import duties. President Donald Trump has announced a blizzard of tariff actions since taking office in January. On Wednesday, Trump unveiled a 25% levy on imported cars and light trucks starting next week. Economists say the manner in which the tariffs are being handled is not supportive of economic activity.
Business and consumer sentiment have sagged. The odds of a recession have risen, with the nation's trade partners also expected to retaliate through duties of their own.
""Profit margins are a leading recession indicator and, at least before the disruptions that will be caused by the tariff hikes, there was no reason to expect a recession in 2025,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.
Profits from current production with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased $204.7 billion, or at a 5.4% rate, last quarter, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Profits declined $15.0 billion, or at a 0.4% pace, in the July-September quarter.
Profits increased $281.3 billion in 2024 after rising by $229.8 billion in 2023. A measure that is conceptually most similar to S&P 500 profits increased at a 6.7% pace after declining at a 0.3% pace in the July-September period.
""Corporate profit margins remain solid, which is one reason that layoffs remain subdued,"" said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ""If corporate profit margins compress because of a sudden weakening in the economy or higher input costs because of tariffs and the inability to pass them onto consumers, it could lay the groundwork for layoffs.""
RESILIENT LABOR MARKET
Labor market resilience was reinforced by a separate report from the Labor Department showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 224,000 for the week ended March 22, broadly in line with economists' expectations.
But companies are hesitant to hire more workers, resulting in those who have lost their jobs experiencing difficulties finding new ones.
Economists expect the Trump administration's aggressive trade policy and an ambitious campaign to drastically downsize the federal government through deep spending cuts and mass firings to shake labor market stability.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, decreased 25,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.856 million during the week ending March 15, the claims report showed.
U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields were mostly higher.
Consumers, eager to avoid higher prices from imports, front-loaded purchases of goods last quarter, driving spending and keeping the economic expansion on track.
Gross domestic product increased at an upwardly revised 2.4% annualized rate, the BEA said in its third estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. Growth was previously estimated at a 2.3% pace. The economy grew at a 3.1% rate in the third quarter.
Strong profits boosted an alternative measure of economic growth. Gross domestic income grew at a 4.5% rate after rising at a 1.4% pace in the July-September period.
GDP and GDI generally should be equal, but in practice they differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data. Annual benchmark revisions tend to close the gap between GDP and GDI.
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 3.5% rate. Gross domestic output grew at a 2.2% pace in the third quarter.
There are signs that GDP growth has significantly slowed in the first quarter because of snowstorms and unseasonably cold weather as well as trade policy uncertainty. Growth estimates for the January-March quarter are mostly below a 1.5% rate and the odds of a contraction are high. The Fed last week left interest rates unchanged, an acknowledgement of the uncertainty swirling around the economy.

"Exporters body says 27 pc US tariffs pose challenges, but India better-placed than rivals",https://www.livemint.com/economy/exporters-body-says-27-pc-us-tariffs-pose-challenges-but-india-better-placed-than-rivals-11743653889727.html,"New Delhi, Apr 3 (PTI) Indian exporters' body FIEO on Thursday said the 27 per cent tariffs or import duties announced by US President Donald Trump pose challenges for domestic players but India's position remains comparatively more favourable than that of its competitor nations.
Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) President S C Ralhan said that despite the tariffs, certain sectors in India, including apparel, gems and jewellery, leather, electronics, chemicals, plastics, and furniture, may experience a diversion of exports, potentially offsetting some adverse effects.
""While these tariffs do present challenges, India's position remains comparatively favourable. For instance, Vietnam faces a 46 per cent tariff, China 34 per cent, and Indonesia 32 per cent, placing India in a relatively better position than key competitors such as Vietnam, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar,"" Ralhan said.
He added that the timely conclusion of a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) between India and the US is crucial to mitigate these tariffs and provide relief to Indian exporters.
""Such an agreement could establish a structured framework for resolving tariff challenges , thereby reducing the likelihood of unilateral trade measures or retaliatory tariffs,"" he said.
The two countries are negotiating the agreement with an aim to conclude the first phase by fall (September-October) this year and more than doubling the bilateral trade in goods and services to USD 500 billion by 2030 from the current USD 191 billion.
The US has announced 27 per cent reciprocal tariffs on India saying New Delhi imposes high import duties on American goods, as the Donald Trump administration aims to reduce the country's trade deficit and boost manufacturing.
Imports from India are already facing a 25 per cent tariff on steel, aluminium, and auto sectors in the US. For remaining products, India is subject to a base line tariff of 10 per cent between April 5-8. Then the tariff will rise to country-specific 27 per cent starting April 9.
From 2021-22 to 2023-24, the US was India's largest trading partner. The US accounts for about 18 per cent of India's total goods exports, 6.22 per cent in imports, and 10.73 per cent in bilateral trade.
With America, India had a trade surplus (the difference between imports and exports) of USD 35.32 billion in goods in 2023-24. This was USD 27.7 billion in 2022-23, USD 32.85 billion in 2021-22, USD 22.73 billion in 2020-21, and USD 17.26 billion in 2019-20.
In 2024, India's main exports to the US included drug formulations and biologicals (USD 8.1 billion), telecom instruments (USD 6.5 billion), precious and semi-precious stones (USD 5.3 billion), petroleum products (USD 4.1 billion), gold and other precious metal jewellery (USD 3.2 billion), ready-made garments of cotton, including accessories (USD 2.8 billion), and products of iron and steel (USD 2.7 billion).
Imports included crude oil (USD 4.5 billion), petroleum products (USD 3.6 billion), coal, coke (USD 3.4 billion), cut and polished diamonds (USD 2.6 billion), electric machinery (USD 1.4 billion), aircraft, spacecraft and parts (USD 1.3 billion), and gold (USD 1.3 billion).

IMF and World Bank Brace for Trump’s ‘America First’ Makeover,https://www.livemint.com/economy/imf-and-world-bank-brace-for-trump-s-america-first-makeover-11743436866655.html,"The International Monetary Fund and World Bank are making their case against a potential breakup with the US under President Donald Trump.
The sister institutions — major forces of US global influence since World War II — are bracing for impact from Trump’s radical makeover of international relations, and pitching the administration on the value they bring to its more transactional America First ethos.
That comes amid the risk of a potentially extreme step — US withdrawal from the institutions, as advocated by Project 2025, the Republican playbook whose authors have helped shape policy in Trump’s second term. Trump has ordered a review of the US relationship with international organizations, including the IMF and World Bank, which is due by early August.
The leaders of the IMF and World Bank have met with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the top official representing the US at the institutions, to explain how they benefit US interests, partly seeking to rebut criticism from within the Trump orbit, according to people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified as the discussions have been private.
The IMF’s Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President Ajay Banga have made similar points to the administration in separate engagements. They argue that they can cover their own administrative costs and their structure magnifies the impact of US contributions. And they say that the US, as the biggest shareholder, already has the power to shape policies. Washington’s stake is about 16% for the IMF and about 17% for the bank’s oldest fund.
They’ve also stressed that their missions — global financial stability for the fund and development for the bank — benefit the US, including creating demand for exports and heading off financial or humanitarian crises.
“There’s a huge amount of uncertainty right now,” said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council‘s GeoEconomics Center and former adviser to the IMF through most of Trump’s first term. During that time, he said, the administration recognized the value of the fund and engaged constructively. Now, “the range of outcomes is as wide as can possibly be,” he said.
The issue is likely to arise next month as the IMF and World Bank host global finance and central bank chiefs at the annual Spring Meetings in Washington starting April 21.
Georgieva “has had very constructive discussions with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other representatives of the US administration,” the IMF said in a response to questions. “We look forward to continued engagement with the US administration to promote growth and prosperity in the US and around the world.”
The World Bank said it’s updated the administration on its reforms, focus on job creation and efforts to spur private capital. “Like every shareholder, they want to see the value of their contributions — and we know that trust is earned through delivery,” it said in a statement.
For the fund and the bank, the nightmare scenario is that the US leaves them behind. The Project 2025 report, published by the conservative Heritage Foundation, argues that the institutions “espouse economic theories and policies that are inimical to American free market and limited government principles,” including higher taxes.
Washington’s best option, it says, is to withdraw rather than push for reforms.
“Conservatives and other pro-market folks have been trying to reform these institutions for decades,” said David Burton, a senior fellow in economic policy at the Heritage Foundation, and one of the authors of Project 2025. “They’re incapable of serious reforms and consistently hostile to US national interests.”
Banga has stressed the bank is focused on development, not charity or humanitarian work. He’s also highlighted his efforts to shift the bank toward funding nuclear power projects, as well as renewables and natural gas, as a source of low-carbon energy.
Both institutions have made climate change and its impacts a focus of their work, an issue that’s controversial for the Trump administration, which has promoted fossil fuels over renewables.
In the past, US Treasury secretaries have laid out the White House’s expectations or demands from the IMF and World Bank ahead of their spring or fall meetings, as a way to set the agenda.
In the meantime, the administration has yet to appoint a Treasury undersecretary of international affairs, who manages the relationship with the institutions, or named executive directors to their boards, meaning the US has been abstaining from votes.
A Treasury spokesman confirmed Bessent met with Georgieva and Banga, but declined to provide details.
Withdrawing from the IMF and World Bank would make the global economy less stable and slow development, said Brent Neiman, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and former Treasury official during the Biden administration.
“If the IMF as an institution didn’t yet exist, we’d want to create something just like it,” Neiman said.

Finance MinisterNirmala Sitharamansaid while discussing theFinance Bill'25that because the previous Income Tax Act did not provide legal backing for checking digital assets, it has prompted the government to introduce specific measures in the proposed legislation.
“Income Tax Law did not give legal backing to checkdigital assets, so have included it. Added checking of digital elements in the Income Tax Act, Law should give legal backing,” said FM Sitharaman on the new Income Tax Bill.

Under the new framework of the Finance Bill 2025, tax officials can access encrypted communications, cloud storage, and digital asset exchanges if they believe a person has concealed taxable income orcryptocurrency holdings.
FM Sitharaman highlighted that digital forensics played a crucial role in unearthing unaccounted money. ""Encrypted messages on mobile phones led to unearthing₹250 crore unaccounted money. Evidence of crypto assets has been detected in WhatsApp messages. WhatsApp communication helped unearth₹200 crore unaccounted money,"" said FM Sitharaman on the new bill.

She also noted that Google Maps history was used to determine the locations frequently visited to hide cash, and Instagram accounts were analysed to establish Benami property ownership. As part of the Finance Bill, the step aligns tax enforcement with technological advancements, ensuring that virtual digital assets such as cryptocurrencies do not escape scrutiny.
The new tax bill allows officials to access communication platforms like emails, WhatsApp, and Telegram, as well as enterprise software and storage servers businesses use to conceal financial transactions. ""Gathering evidence from digital accounts is essential not only to prove tax evasion before a court of law but also to compute the exact amount of tax evaded,'' said the FM.

South Korea approves reforms to shore up $830 bln state pension fund,https://www.livemint.com/economy/south-korea-approves-reforms-to-shore-up-830-bln-state-pension-fund-11742458501814.html,"SEOUL, - South Korea's parliament on Thursday passed a bill to reform the country's $830 billion pension fund and delay the depletion of the state fund that has been on track to run out by the mid-2050s due to a rapidly ageing population.
The bill's passage marks the first time parliament has agreed to a major shake-up in the state pension fund in 18 years and could delay depletion.
Under the legislative amendment, contributions and payouts will rise, the former more steeply, after the ruling People Power Party and the main opposition Democratic Party agreed on the rate of increases.
The contribution rate for the mandatory pension scheme will rise to 13% of income, from the current 9%, as proposed by the government in September. The contribution rate will increase at a different pace for each age group.
The nominal income replacement rate, the ratio of pension payouts to average income, will be increased to 43%, from this year's 41.5%. The rate had previously been set to be lowered by 0.5 percentage points each year to 40% by 2028.
That is higher than the government's proposal of keeping it at last year's 42%. The left-leaning Democratic Party, which holds a majority in parliament, had argued for a hike to 45%.
Pension credits for childbirth and military service will also be expanded in line with the government proposal.
""It is very meaningful that we have brought a reform to the pension system for the first time in 18 years,"" said Choi Sang-mok, the country's acting president.
Still, more reforms and a mechanism automatically adjusting pension payments are also necessary for the sustainability of the pension scheme, Choi added.
The reform is expected to delay the depletion of South Korea's public pension fund, established in 1988, but by less than the 16 years estimated for the earlier government proposal.
The public pension fund, the world's third-largest with 1,212.9 trillion won in assets as of the end of 2024, is expected to be depleted by 2056 under the current scheme as payments start to outpace contributions from 2041.
South Korea's population has been declining since 2020 when it peaked at 51.84 million, with people aged 64 or older accounting for 15.7% of the total. That ratio is expected to rise to 34.4% by 2040 and 46.4% by 2070, according to government estimates.

"Trump’s ‘tariff tantrums’: POTUS hints at relief, aides insist ‘no backing down’",https://www.livemint.com/economy/trumps-tariff-tantrums-potus-hints-at-relief-aides-insist-no-backing-down-11743731498652.html,"Just a day after Donald Trump's tariff bombs hit China, India, other countries, and sent Asian stocks tumbling, the POTUS declared that the US was open to reducing the tariffs if other nations were able to offer something ‘phenomenal’.
US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, however, told CNN that there isn't  “any chance” that “President Donald Trump is gonna back off on tariffs.”
On Thursday, April 3, Donald Trump indicated that the White House was open to negotiations on tariffs despite the insistence of some top officials, reportedBloomberg. Trump had also mentioned that he spent the day speaking with parties requesting tariff relief.
Lutnick clearly declared that there was no way Trump would back off on the tariffs. When asked if there was any room for negotiation, the US Commerce Secretary reiterated his previous statement, and added:
“But countries can fix their tariffs, their non-tariff trade barriers which are much much rougher.”
Reportedly, Trump had reiterated that he would ‘particulary’ be willing to offer tariff relief for China if Beijing approved the sale of the US operations of ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok social video app.
TikTok is currently facing a April 5, Saturday deadline for divestment, unless Trump offers an extension as part of his efforts to broker a deal.
Donald Trump also added that he held talks with automotive industry executives on Thursday, as well as with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who he indicated might visit the US next week, reportedBloomberg.
On Wednesday, April 2, Donald Trump unveiled broad reciprocal tariff targeting the trade partners of US.
Dubbed ‘Liberation Day’ announcements, the measures did not include any country-specific exemptions.
Trump introduced new tariff rates for over 180 countries and also announced a standard 10 percent baseline tariff in addition to the country-specific rates.
Donald Trump announced a 27 per cent reciprocal tariff on India—half the rate India imposes on US imports. He also announced a 25 per cent tariff on automobile imports to the country.
Following Trump's tariff blow, Asian stocks tumbled. India, however, showed resilience with only a 0.40 per cent decline in markets, while regional peers suffered bigger losses.

MIIS coverage: Panel says India’s global economic choices in post-WTO world are sound,https://www.livemint.com/economy/global-trade-policies-us-india-trade-donald-trump-world-trade-organisation-bilateral-talks-protectionist-trade-policies-11743253593050.html,"Global trade policies employed by the Donald Trump-led US government have created an economic order where entities such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) are futile, but India is sending the right messages to global powers by actively participating in bilateral talks with the US, said two veterans of trade and geopolitics at the Mint India Investment Summit 2025 in Mumbai.
“I think the message from Delhi to Washington has gone very clearly,” said Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow at Gateway House. “We are ready for a mutually beneficial, mutually negotiated agreement (with the US).”
Bhatia, a 37-year career diplomat and a former India ambassador to various countries including Myanmar and Mexico, clarified that India had made a sound economic choice to negotiate with the US for a bilateral agreement that could potentially benefit both the world’s largest economy and the fastest growing one.
Bhatia expressed confidence that India's interests would be safeguarded in the talks. “There is confidence, there is maturity that we understand what is happening in the world, and we would try to deploy these changes and shifts in such a manner that India’s interests, India’s political interests, economic interests, are not affected,” he said.

The global economic order, set in stone after the second World War, is now up for renegotiation as governments across the globe adopt more protectionist trade policies, and dismantle the progress made by globalisation. Donald Trump's retouches to all of the US’s bilateral agreements should be taken seriously, and we should not demonise the head of state, said the former diplomat.
Anup Wadhawan, former commerce secretary in the Union government, concurred, and critiqued Trump’s approach towards measuring economic growth and prowess only using the goods trade surplus.
“President Trump's rhetoric is very misleading. He is looking at the goods trade deficit as the only measure of American success. But you need to look at the economic success of our country much beyond goods. The US economy has graduated beyond goods,” he pointed out, adding that the US was a services-based economy and that lots of developing countries had compromised to provide economic benefit to American interests, such as big tech companies.
“They are a services economy, they are a tech economy. They are, you know, the Microsofts, the Amazons, the Facebooks, the Googles, they are earning billions of dollars abroad,” said Wadhawan.
American big tech companies have long had a global presence, where they have negotiated agreements with multiple developing nations that benefit the corporate and not the host nation, Wadhawan said. He also said the WTO was created as an equitable organisation to further the cause of developing nations, but that it failed to bridge the development differential between developed and developing nations.
“Ultimately, America will realize their problem is not exploitation by the world. Their problem is not that we have not done well as an economy because of their trading partners being unfair to them. They will realize that what is wrong with America is lack of equity, and ultimately, they have to face the consequences,” said Wadhavan.
Bhatia said tariffs have a peculiar reputation in India, especially at a time when India was negotiating a trade deal with the US. “Tariffs are being seen by a large section of people in India as our one pressing opportunity to reform our economy,” he said. “Just as we faced several important moments in the past, this is a moment for us to bring competitiveness to our products by lowering down duties somewhat to the same level as ASEAN countries.”

This also follows the announcement made by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech for FY26 that domestic manufacturing as well as India's businesses becoming globally competitive are key growth engines for the country in the coming years.
At a time when India is negotiating with the US, it is also negotiating a new relationship with its neighbour China. Bhatia said that serious efforts are being taken to ensure that India-China relations are bettered. But it is unlikely that these relations will return to the age-old “Hindi Chini bhai bhai” moniker, he clarified.
“There is an America factor in India-China relations. And there is a China factor in India-America relations. Yet, serious efforts are being made to take the negotiations forward. And the hope is that things will move in a positive direction,” said Bhatia.

"RBI to slash interest rates on April 9, once more in August in shortest easing cycle on record: Report",https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-to-slash-interest-rates-on-april-9-once-more-in-august-in-shortest-easing-cycle-on-record-report-11743080585329.html,"TheReserve Bank of India (RBI)will cut interest rates at a second straight meeting on April 9, with just one more cut expected in August, which would mark the shortest easing cycle on record, a Reuters poll of economists found.
Withinflationin India easing to a seven-month low of 3.61 per cent in February and the economy forecast to grow at 6.4 per cent this fiscal year, the weakest in four years, the central bank has room to cut rates further.
A strong majority of economists, 54 of 60 in the March 18-27 Reuters poll, expected the RBI to cut its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to six per cent at the conclusion of its April 7-9 meeting. One respondent predicted a 50 basis point cut, while the remaining five expected no change.

""They have injected liquidity, so that's covering some part of the liquidity deficit, that's good. But I think the rates also need to fall now because we have seen a palpable slowdown in consumption and investment and the real rates need to adjust from that perspective.""
TheRBI has injected about $64 billion of rupees into the banking systemover the last few months to increase money supply, which economists said was needed for rate cuts to work their way into the broader economy.
However, several economists in the poll said it would take a few more months for that to happen. ""If transmission needs to happen, especially in a rate-cutting cycle, (banking sector) liquidity needs to be on the positive side,"" said Indranil Pan, chief economist at Yes Bank.

Median forecasts in the Reuters poll showed the RBI will keep interest rates at six per cent in the June 4-6 meeting. However, a narrow majority of economists, 29 of 49, expected the interest rate to fall to 5.75 per cent in the August meeting, a view unchanged from last month.
This is expected to be followed by a prolonged pause until at least the first half of next year. With 75 basis points in rate cuts, this cycle will be the shortest easing cycle since early 2000, when the RBI began using the repo rate as its main policy tool.
""I think this will be a shallow rate cut cycle to begin with...Depending on what happens on the global front, drags of capital outflows and what the US Fed does,"" said Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC bank. ""We were always of the view that there will be a maximum of three rate cuts that the RBI will deliver...Beyond the cut in April, we remain divided between June and August.""

RBI MPC Meet: Another rate cut likely? Central Bank to hold FY26 first policy meeting starting — April 7,https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-mpc-meet-another-rate-cut-likely-central-bank-to-hold-fy26-first-policy-meeting-starting-april-7-11743931370769.html,"RBI MPC Meet:India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), will hold its bi-monthly meeting starting Monday, April 7, to decide on the key benchmark interest rates or repo rates.
The upcoming meeting will be the firstmonetary policymeeting for the financial year 2025-26, which will determine the outcome of the key lending rates for the central bank, scheduled to be announced on Wednesday, April 9, 2025.
RBIconducts the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting every two months in a year, marking six meetings for a financial year where it decides on the interest rates based on multiple factors like money supply, inflation outlook, and other macroeconomic indicators.
According toICICI Bank'sdefinition, aRepo Rateis the interest rate at which the central bank (RBI) lends money to the nation's commercial banks when there is a shortage of funds in their system. It is the key borrowing rate that commercial banks use to borrow money to cater for their short-term needs against government securities.
As RBI prepares for its MPC meeting, experts anticipate that the central bank will likely cut its repo rates for the second consecutive time since GovernorSanjay Malhotratook charge before the February 2025 MPC Meeting.
In the February 2025 MPC meeting, the committee headed by Governor Malhotra cut the key benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent from their earlier 6.5 per cent levels.
This rate cut was the first reduction after nearly two and a half years since May 2020, which was delayed due to inflation's grasp on the nation.
Bank of Baroda's Chief Economist, Madan Sabnavis, said that the inflation and liquidity have settled down, which is likely to be a step for a 25-basis-points rate cut this time in the upcoming MPC announcement.
“While it does look like conditions are rather clear for another 25 bps cut in repo rate this time with theinflationprospects being benign and liquidity having settled down, it is also expected that the stance will change to accommodative, meaning...that there could be more rate cuts in the offing during the course of the year,” Sabnavis told the news agencyPTI.
The rating agency, ICRA, also estimated that the committee would reduce the rates by 25 basis points in the upcoming announcement, maintaining a “neutral stance” for the Indian economy.
“While the Central Bank's liquidity interventions are likely to continue with the target of offsetting the upcoming drain arising from the unwinding of the short positions in its forward book and the maturity of long tenor VRRs (Variable Rate Repo), we do not expect any major announcements around liquidity injections, such as a CRR cut in the MPC meeting,” ICRA added, as per the agency report.

It was decided after the four-day negotiations of senior officers from India and the US. These negotiations ended on Saturday, March 29.
For the shared objective ofpromoting growth that ensures fairness, national security and job creation, both sides have through four days of discussions broadly come to an understanding on the next steps towards a mutually beneficial, multi-sector BTA, with the goal to finalise its first tranche by fall 2025.

Sectoral expert-level engagements under the BTA will start virtually in the coming weeks and pave the path for an early negotiating round in person.
During these discussions, the two sides held a productive exchange of views on deepening bilateral cooperation in priority areas, including increasing market access, reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers and deepening supply chain integration. A team of US officials, headed by Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia Brendan Lynch, was present for the negotiations.
The meeting follows the visit of Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal to the US from March 4-6 during which he met his US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and subsequent video conferences between the two sides.
""The successful conclusion of the discussions reflects progress in efforts to expandIndia-US bilateral trade and investment relationsto promote prosperity, security and innovation in both the countries,"" the ministry said. The steps are designed to unlock new opportunities for businesses, drive bilateral economic integration, and reinforce the economic partnership between the two trading partners.
""India and the US expressed satisfaction with the outcomes of the meeting and reaffirmed their dedication to ongoing collaboration. Both sides look forward to building on this milestone in the coming months to finalise the BTA, ensuring it aligns with the shared goals of prosperity, resilience, and mutual benefit,"" it added.

On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a ""very smart man"" and a ""great friend of mine"" while emphasising that tariff discussions would ""work out very well between India and our country"".
The remarks are significant since Trump has criticised the alleged high tariffs charged by India and other countries on American goods. He has announced plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on its key trading partners, including India, on April 2.
""India is one of the highest tariffing nations in the world. It's brutal, it's brutal. They're very smart. He (Modi) is a very smart man and a great friend of mine. We had very good talks. I think it's going to work out very well between India and our country,"" Trump said.
India and the US are aiming to conclude the first phase of the agreement by the fall of 2025 (September-October). They have also set a target to more than double bilateral trade to USD 500 billion by 2030 from the current over USD 190 billion.
While the US has demanded duty concessions in sectors like certain industrial goods, automobiles, wines, petrochemical products, dairy, agriculture items such as apples, tree nuts, and alfalfa hay; India may look at duty cuts for labour-intensive sectors like textiles.
Indian industry and exporters have asked the government to protect them against the USA's reciprocal tariffs. They have sought exemption from those tariffs as it would hurt them severely as the US is India's largest trading partner.
The US is pushing India to negotiate a large and grand bilateral trade agreement while seeking to open the agriculture sector for American businesses. According to experts, India is unlikely to include dairy and agriculture in trade negotiations as it is a politically sensitive sector.

The US agri exports to India was USD 1.6 billion in 2024. Key exports include almonds (in shell -- USD 868 million); pistachios (USD 121 million), apples (USD 21 million), ethanol (ethyl alcohol USD 266 million).
In June 2023, India announced removal of retaliatory import duties on eight US products, including chickpeas, lentils, and apples, which were imposed in 2019 in response to America's measure to increase tariffs on steel and aluminium products.
In 2024, India's main exports to the US included drug formulations, biological ($8.1 billion), telecom instruments ($6.5 billion), precious and semi-precious stones ($5.3 billion), petroleum products ($4.1 billion), gold and other precious metal jewellery ($3.2 billion), ready-made garments of cotton including accessories ($2.8 billion), and products of iron and steel ($2.7 billion).
Imports included crude oil ($4.5 billion), petroleum products ($3.6 billion), coal, coke ($3.4 billion), cut and polished diamonds ($ 2.6 billion), electric machinery ($ 1.4 billion), aircraft, space crafts and parts ($ 1.3 billion), and gold ($ 1.3 billion).
In 2023-24, the US was the largest trading partner of India with $119.71 billion bilateral trade in goods ($ 77.51 billion worth of exports, $42.19 billion of imports, with $35.31 billion trade surplus). India has received $67.8 billion in foreign direct investments from America during April 2000 and September 2024.

India forex reserves drop USD 1.8 billion to USD 639 billion in latest week,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-forex-reserves-drop-usd-1-8-billion-to-usd-639-billion-in-latest-week-11741496617708.html,"New Delhi [India], March 9 (ANI): India's foreign exchange reserves slumped in the week that ended on February 28, as per latest RBI data.
In the week under consideration, the foreign exchange reserves declined by USD 1.781 billion to USD 638.698 billion.
Forex reserves had slumped for about four months, recently hitting an 11-month low. Then followed the latest rollercoaster movement, with gains some weeks and declines the next.
Forex reserves started falling after touching an all-time high of USD 704.89 billion in September. They are now about 10 percent lower from their peak.
The decline in reserves is most likely due to RBI intervention, aimed at preventing a sharp depreciation of the Rupee. The Indian Rupee is now at or near its all-time low against the US dollar.
The latest RBI data showed that India's foreign currency assets (FCA), the largest component of forex reserves, stood at USD 543.350 billion.
Gold reserves currently amount to USD 73.272 billion, according to RBI data.
Estimates suggest that India's foreign exchange reserves are sufficient to cover approximately 10-11 months of projected imports.
In 2023, India added around USD 58 billion to its foreign exchange reserves, contrasting with a cumulative decline of USD 71 billion in 2022. In 2024, the reserves rose by a little over USD 20 billion.
Foreign exchange reserves, or FX reserves, are assets held by a nation's central bank or monetary authority, primarily in reserve currencies such as the US Dollar, with smaller portions in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling.
The RBI often intervenes by managing liquidity, including selling dollars, to prevent steep Rupee depreciation. The RBI strategically buys dollars when the Rupee is strong and sells when it weakens. (ANI)

Safeguard measures to cut India’s steel imports by 50 pc in FY26: Experts,https://www.livemint.com/economy/safeguard-measures-to-cut-india-s-steel-imports-by-50-pc-in-fy26-experts-11742466588379.html,"New Delhi, Mar 20 (PTI) India's steel imports could reduce by 50 per cent in FY26 while domestic manufacturers' profitability is expected to improve, if the government levies a safeguard duty on inbound shipments, experts have said.
The Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), the investigation arm of the commerce ministry, has recommended imposition of a 12 per cent provisional safeguard duty for 200 days on certain steel products with an aim to protect domestic players from surge in imports. The final decision to impose the duty will be taken by the finance ministry.
The development is credit positive and expected to lead to a 50 per cent reduction in India's steel imports in FY26, said Girish Kadam, Senior Vice President and Group Head - Corporate Sector Ratings at ICRA Ltd.
With imports slated to materially decline, and domestic demand poised to grow at a healthy rate of 7-8 per cent in FY26, ICRA expects the industry's capacity utilisation inch up to a more comfortable level of 83 per cent in FY26 from the four-year low of 78 per cent being witnessed in the current fiscal, he said.
Dhruv Goel, CEO of markets research firm BigMint, said the anticipation of a safeguard duty had been looming, but with the recommendation of 12 per cent duty, the market now has clarity on the landed price implications for upcoming imports.
""The immediate market reaction could see prices rise by₹1,000-1,500 per tonne in the near term. The imposition of the safeguard duty is likely to reduce import volumes, creating opportunities for domestic mills to enhance profitability in the upcoming quarter,"" he said.
Sehul Bhatt, Director -- Research, Crisil Intelligence, said the imposition of provisional safeguard duty on some non-alloy and alloy steel flat products will provide pricing support to local manufacturers in the first half of fiscal 2026. The announcement comes amid evolving trade dynamics, where some countries have imposed restrictions on imports of steel.
India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has said that the government has initiated a safeguard duty investigation on certain steel products to protect domestic players from low-cost imports. However, if safeguard duties are implemented, they could provide tailwind to the prices.
Last year in December, the DGTR started the investigation into the sudden surge in imports of 'Non-Alloy and Alloy Steel Flat Products', used in various industries, including fabrication, pipe making, construction, capital goods, auto, tractors, bicycles, and electrical panels.
The investigations were conducted following a complaint from the Indian Steel Association on behalf of its members including ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, AMNS Khopoli, JSW Steel, JSW Steel Coated Products, Bhushan Power & Steel, Jindal Steel and Power, and state-owned Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL).
The directorate in its probe has preliminarily found that there is a recent, sudden, sharp and significant increase in the imports of these products into India, causing and threatening to cause serious injury to the domestic industry/producers.
The directorate has said in a notification dated March 18 that there exist critical circumstances, where any delay in application of provisional safeguard measures would cause damage which would be difficult to repair.
It said there is a necessity for immediate application of provisional safeguard measures.

In actual terms, the fiscal deficit -- the gap between expenditure and revenue -- was₹13,46,852 crore during the April-February 2024-25 period.
The deficit was 86.5 per cent of revised estimates (RE) of 2023-24 in the year-ago period.

NBFC sector strengthens with RBIs positive stance and rate cut support for growth: Jefferies,https://www.livemint.com/economy/nbfc-sector-strengthens-with-rbis-positive-stance-and-rate-cut-support-for-growth-jefferies-11742017952756.html,"New Delhi [India], March 15 (ANI): The fundamentals of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are showing signs of improvement as macroeconomic challenges ease and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) adopts a more supportive stance, according to Jefferies.
With stabilizing asset quality, improving liquidity, and emerging rate tailwinds, the sector is poised for steady growth. The overall macroeconomic environment is improving with increased government spending and RBI's measures to ease liquidity constraints.
The central bank's recent risk weight reduction on bank lending to NBFCs signals a constructive approach, which should enhance funding access, particularly for smaller NBFCs.
Additionally, a recent 25-basis-point interest rate cut, along with potential future cuts, is expected to support net interest margins (NIMs) across the sector.
The asset quality (AQ) of NBFCs is showing stabilization across key segments. Collections have improved in recent months, and while gross non-performing assets (GNPA) may rise slightly in Q1 FY26, the increase is expected to be lower than last year.
However, the microfinance institution (MFI) segment remains under stress, particularly in Karnataka, where a microfinance ordinance impacted collection efficiency.
Despite some improvements in other states, the transition to MFIN 2.0 regulations in April 2025 could add further pressure to the MFI segment.
However, spillover effects from unsecured MFI loans to secured loan products remain limited. NBFC exposure to MFI overlaps is highest in gold loans (9 per cent), small-ticket loans like micro LAP/PL (6-7 per cent), affordable housing (4-5 per cent), and two-wheeler loans (2 per cent), while commercial vehicle (CV) loans remain largely unaffected.
The vehicle financing sector is experiencing mixed trends. Demand for light commercial vehicles (LCVs) is improving, while medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs) continue to face muted demand and rising competition.
The affordable housing finance sector (AHFCs) is witnessing steady disbursements, though some pricing pressure is emerging due to aggressive competition from larger players.
Post-RBI's 25bps rate cut, PSU banks have lowered home loan rates to 8.1-8.2 per cent, but private banks have yet to follow suit.
Larger housing finance companies (HFCs) with fixed liabilities may experience NIM pressure, making AHFCs a preferred choice due to their better pricing power. Among AHFCs, Home First Finance remains a top pick.
While NBFC stocks have declined 3-41 per cent from their six-month peaks, top large retail and auto-focused NBFCs have outperformed the broader market. (ANI)

External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US last month, both sides announced plans to negotiate a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA). Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal was in the US and met his counterparts in the US government. Goyal said the two governments are advancing discussions on a multi-sector bilateral trade pact.
“Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen the supply chain integration between the two countries,” added Piyush Goyal. The MEA spokesperson said the discussions are centred on boosting two-way trade in goods and services.

US President Donald Trump has been relentless in his pursuit of a tariff overhaul ever since assuming office in January. After making Mexico, China, and Canada his first victims (even though he paused some of the moves for a limited time), andthreatening 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports, he then announced his intention to introduce reciprocal tariffs on US’s imports from other countries, including China, India.
Piyush Goyal’s delegation in Washington is seeking a balance between securing favourable trade terms and protecting domestic industries. The US, set to announce new tariffs on Indian goods by March 12, sees energy and petrochemicals as key components of future trade. Meanwhile, India, a growing petrochemical consumer, wants to ensure its industries—plastics, textiles, and pharmaceuticals—do not rely on imports but also create value at home.

"India spent  ₹1.15 lakh crore on purchasing Russian crude oil since Ukraine war, China emerges biggest buyer: Report",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-spent-rs-1-15-lakh-crore-on-purchasing-russian-crude-oil-since-ukraine-war-china-emerges-biggest-buyer-report-11741341400471.html,"India, the world's third largest oil-consuming and importing nation, has spent 112.5 billion euros or about₹1.5 lakh crore on buyingcrude oilfrom Russia since the start of theUkraine war. According to the European think tank Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), India's payments to Russia for fossil fuels since February 24, 2022, have revealed the figures.
""According to our estimates, since the beginning of the war, Russia earned EUR 835 billion in revenue from fossil fuel exports,"" it said. China was the biggest buyer of Russian fossil fuels at EUR 235 billion (made up of EUR 170 billion for oil, EUR 34.3 billion for coal and EUR 30.5 billion for gas).
Also Read:Donald Trump warns Russia: Sanctions and tariffs coming unless ceasefire, final settlement agreement on peace is reached
According to CREA, India bought fossil fuels worth EUR 205.84 billion from Russia from the beginning of the war until March 2, 2025. This comprised EUR 112.5 billion (USD 121.59 billion) for crude oil, which is refined into fuels like petrol and diesel at refineries, and EUR 13.25 billion for coal.
India, which is more than 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its crude oil needs, spent USD 232.7 billion on crude imports in 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023) and USD 234.3 billion in 2023-24. In the first 10 months of the current fiscal, the Asian economy spent nearly USD 195.2 billion.

India, which has traditionally sourced its oil from the Middle East, began importing a large volume of oil from Russia soon after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This was primarily because Russian oil was available at a significant discount to other international benchmarks due to Western sanctions and some European countries shunning purchases.
This led to a dramatic rise inIndia's imports of Russian oil, which grew from less than one per cent of its total crude oil imports to a staggering 40 per cent in a short period. According to CREA, some refineries in India turned Russian crude oil into fuels like petrol and diesel, which were exported to Europe and other G7 countries. The latest US sanctions led to imports falling after India shunned cargoes in sanctioned ships by banned entities.
Russia, however, continues to be India's top oil source. In February, India imported 1.48 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Russia, up from 1.67 million bpd in the previous month. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, it triggered a series of sanctions from the United States, the European Union, and other Western nations aimed at crippling Russia's economy. One of the main sanctions was on Russian oil exports, which significantly impacted Russia's ability to sell oil to European markets.

As a result, Russia began offering crude oil at heavily discounted prices to find new buyers for oil. With its large energy needs and an economy sensitive to oil price fluctuations, India found this offer too attractive to ignore. The price discount on Russian oil, sometimes USD 18-20 per barrel lower than the market price of other oil, allowed India to procure oil at a much cheaper rate. The discounts have recently shrunk to less than USD 3 a barrel.

"Donald Trump’s tariff impact: What’s likely to get more costly for you — Jewellery, iPhones, Nikes & more, check here",https://www.livemint.com/economy/donald-trump-tariffs-trade-war-impact-what-likely-more-costly-expensive-for-you-indians-imports-us-news-exports-economy-11743656052429.html,"Trump Tariff Impact: United States PresidentDonald Trumphas unveiled a comprehensive tariff policy, imposing at least a 10 per cent duty on nearly all goods entering the US.
A total of 180 countries were hit by sweeping reciprocaltariffson April 2, which Donald Trump justified by citing “horrendous imbalances” in the trade sector that he claimed have weakened the country's “industrial base” and posed national security risks.
The White House said the move is aimed at “correcting trade imbalances” and “bolstering American” industries. Most of the announced tariffs will come into effect by April 3 (auto imports), April 5 (non-USMCA trade) and then April 9 (reciprocal tariffs).
From gems and jewellery, to automobiles and iPhones, we take a look at what will likely be impacted by Donald Trump's tariffs tantrum.
The US under Donald Trump has imposed a flat 26 per cent tariff on all goods imported into the country from India. In its statement, the White House noted that the US has a $46 billion trade deficit with India, according to a Reuters report. It said:
India and the US have a $14 billion strong electronic trade, besides $9.9 billion markets forgemsand jewellery. Overall, Indian exports to the US in FY24 reached $77.5 billion, while, India's imports from the US dropped to $42.2 billion in the same period, down 17 per cent.
Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal told Livemint that India’s top exported items to the US are electronics (15.6 per cent of total exports to the US), gems and jewellery (11.5 per cent),pharmaproducts (11 per cent), machinery for nuclear reactors (8.1 per cent) and refined petroleum products (5.5 per cent).
For India in particular, Donald Trump announced a 26 per cent reciprocal tariff—half the rate India imposes on US imports. In addition to this, the earlier announced 25 per cent tariff on automobile imports is also expected to hit Indian auto companies such as Tata Motors.
Notably, Donald Trump spared sectors such as copper, energy and minerals, gold, lumber articles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors, adding that sector-specific tariffs will be imposed at a later date.

Export-Import Bank of India suggested that a 1% reduction in tariffs onIndia’s exportsinfemale labour-intensive sectors could lead to a 0.36% increase in labour supply, a 0.14% rise in gross domestic product, and overall welfare gains estimated at 3.6%.
Exim Bank’s study underscored the economic benefits of lowering trade barriers in industries with high female employment, such as textiles, leather products, food processing, handicrafts, and agriculture.

Women are also employed in electronics assembly, retail, e-commerce, and healthcare—sectors that are sensitive to global trade policies, with tariff changes directly impacting employment and economic opportunities.
Exim Bank’s study also highlighted that women are primarily employed in low-tech, resource-intensive sectors, leaving them vulnerable to global demand fluctuations. Such sectors often face higher tariffs on inputs, making tariff relaxation a key policy recommendation, it added.
The bank’s recommendations come amid US PresidentDonald Trump’s threat to introducereciprocal tariffson US’ imports from India and other countries from 2 April because of high import tariffs levied by these nations on US goods.
Exim Bank also suggested integrating gender considerations into trade agreements, promoting women in public procurement, enhancing their access to export finance, and leveraging e-commerce to boost their market reach.
Releasing the study on Friday, M. Nagaraju, secretary, department of financial services, reiterated the Indian government’s commitment to the economic empowerment of women, citing an increased allocation for gender initiatives in the Union Budget and policy measures for financial inclusion.
“Women entrepreneurs benefit significantly from schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises,” he said.
Anna Wielogorska, regional procurement manager (South Asia) at the World Bank, discussed challengeswomen entrepreneursface in public procurement and praised India’s efforts in improving accessibility for women-led businesses.

According to the statistics ministry’s PeriodicLabour Force Survey2022-23, India’s female labour force participation rate had improved to 37.0% in 2023 from 32.8% in the year prior.
As per Census 2011, the latest conducted, India had 149.8 million female workers, of whom 121.8 million were in rural areas and 28 million in urban areas. Among them, 35.9 million were cultivators, and 61.5 million were agricultural labourers. Of the remaining female workers, 8.5 million were engaged in household industries, and 43.7 million were classified as ‘other workers’.

India stands to gain in an increasingly uncertain world of tariffs: SBI Report,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-stands-to-gain-in-an-increasingly-uncertain-world-of-tariffs-sbi-report-11742188148781.html,"New Delhi [India] March 17 : US President Donald Trump's plan to impose reciprocal tariffs may only lead to a 3-3.5 per cent decline in Indian exports, and the effect will be negated by higher exports, according to SBI Research released on Monday.
""The decline in exports from India to the US could be in the range of 3-3.5 per cent post reciprocal tariffs, if any... which again should be negated through higher export goals across both manufacturing and services fronts, as India has diversified its exports kitty, pitched value addition, exploring alternate areas and works on new routes that transcend from Europe to USA via the Middle-East, redrawing new supply chain algorithms,"" says the report.
India will also get advantage of aluminium and steel tariffs imposed by the US last week.
India runs a marginal trade deficit with the USD 13 million in aluminium goods, and USD 406 million in steel goods. While India doesn't figure among top 10 importers of steel products, accounting for just 1 per cent of imports to the US, it is among the top 10 in aluminium imports. However, its share has dipped from 3 to 2.8 per cent between 2018 and 2024.
India is countering this by diversifying its exports, adding value to products, and exploring alternative markets. By leveraging new trade routes from Europe to the US via the Middle East, India is looking to strengthen its position in the global supply chain.
With rising protectionist measures and evolving supply chain strategies, India is leveraging trade agreements and export diversification to strengthen its position in the global market.
Report stated, ""India has been talking about free trade agreements with several partners - both bilateral and regional - in a bid to boost export-oriented domestic manufacturing.""
To strengthen its manufacturing sector and increase exports, India has been actively engaging in Free Trade Agreements with multiple countries. In the last five years, India has signed 13 FTAs, including with Mauritius, the UAE, and Australia.
The country is currently negotiating agreements with the UK, Canada, and the European Union, focusing on areas such as digital trade, services, and sustainable development. The FTA with the UK alone is projected to boost bilateral trade by USD15 billion by 2030.
With a growing digital economy, experts believe that digital trade agreements could add USD1 trillion to India's GDP by 2025. Additionally, shifting regional supply chains and geopolitical factors, including the US-China trade war, are shaping India's trade strategies.
With ongoing trade negotiations and evolving global economic trends, India's focus on FTAs, digital trade, and export expansion may help it navigate uncertainties and emerge stronger in the global market.

The War on Government Statistics Has Quietly Begun,https://www.livemint.com/economy/the-war-on-government-statistics-has-quietly-begun-11741687284457.html,"In a time of great economic uncertainty, President Donald Trump’s administration quietly took a step last week that could create even more: Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick disbanded the Federal Economic Statistics Advisory Committee.
I realize that the shuttering of an obscure statistical advisory committee may not strike anyone as a scandal, much less an outrage. But as an economist who has presented to the committee, known as FESAC, I know how it improved the information used by both the federal government and private enterprise to make economic decisions. Most Americans do not realize how many aspects of their lives rely on timely and accurate government data.
One of FESAC’s official responsibilities was “exploring ways to enhance the agencies’ economic indicators to make them timelier, more accurate, and more specific to meeting changing demands and future data needs.” In the complex and highly dynamic US economy, this is an ongoing effort — not a one-time task that has been “fulfilled,” which was the Commerce Department’s stated reason for terminating the committee.
The 15 members of the advisory committee, who were unpaid, brought deep technical expertise on economic measurement from the private sector, academia and the non-profit world. They were a sounding board for the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Bureau of Economic Analysis, which produce much of the nation’s official statistics.
If statistics fail to keep up with the changing economy, they lose their usefulness. When the committee last met in December, one focus was on measuring the use and production of artificial intelligence. Staff from the agencies shared existing findings on AI, such as from the Business Trends and Outlook Survey that began in 2022, and outlined new data collection efforts. AI’s current use among businesses has nearly doubled since late 2023, and even more businesses expect to adopt AI in the next six months.
The committee was asked what data products would be most useful. Expert feedback, including a request to harmonize the definitions of AI across surveys and align with cutting-edge research, is especially valuable at the early stages of data collection. The growth and employment effects of AI are among the most pressing questions facing the economy, and external experts are crucial to supporting the creation of high-quality data.
Enhancing official economic statistics under budget constraints often requires creative approaches. At its meeting last June, the committee discussed using private-sector data to create statistics on regional employment and other outcomes. There is considerable demand among businesses and local governments to have timely geographic detail, but it is cost-prohibitive with current government surveys. Members of FESAC, some of whom work at companies like Indeed and JP Morgan Chase, offered first-hand knowledge of the pros and cons of using private-sector data.
The committee contributed far more than just twice-a-year meetings. It also created relationships with the private sector that government agencies could draw on as part of their continuing effort to improve their statistics.
The National Academies of Sciences, in discussing best practices for statistical agencies, argues that external advisory committees are a good way to engage with users of the data and obtain expert advice. Moreover, external evaluation should be part of regular program reviews to ensure quality, relevance and cost-effectiveness. That’s exactly what FESAC did.
The statistical agencies need more, not fewer, resources now to meet their challenges. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly questioned the credibility of US employment statistics. In particular, he claimed that the downward revisions of monthly payrolls showed political interference. Senators Bill Cassidy and Susan Collins asked the Bureau of Labor Statistics to explain why large revisions were happening and how to avoid them. FESAC could have been a valuable resource for possible improvements.
Disbanding FESAC does not advance the administration’s goal of greater efficiency in the government. In 2024, the committee's cost was expected to be a modest $120,000, covering travel expenses and minimal staff support. Virtual-only meetings could have reduced those costs still further, if that was a concern. Regardless, the benefits to the millions of data users from regular reviews by external experts far exceed that negligible cost.
Putting a low-cost, high-value committee on the chopping block does not bode well for other investments in the official statistics. Reductions in staff and budget would likely degrade the quality of the official statistics. Even before Trump took office, all three agencies operated in a tight budget environment.
Reduced transparency in official statistics is perhaps the most troubling aspect of disbanding FESAC. Cutting off agency staff from external advisers creates an environment where political interference could occur much more easily — and go undetected. With political officials such as Lutnick arguing publicly that GDP should exclude government spending, it is especially important to have external, independent experts.
And FESAC is not alone. By executive order, the administration is ending several advisory committees in the federal government, reducing transparency and the technical resources for agencies. It’s a short-sighted approach that could undermine essential government services.

South Korea proposes inheritance tax overhaul to reduce burden,https://www.livemint.com/economy/south-korea-proposes-inheritance-tax-overhaul-to-reduce-burden-11741746689865.html,"SEOUL, - South Korea plans to overhaul inheritance tax codes to make them more equitable and encourage wealth transfer to younger generations, the finance ministry said on Wednesday, in its first step towards addressing a tax burden that has faced criticism.
Although the proposed tax revision does not seek to lower inheritance tax rates, among the world's highest, it aims to shift to a recipient-based inheritance tax system to make the process more equitable, from the current estate tax system.
Under the new codes, taxes will be imposed on the amount of inheritance received by each recipient, rather than the total wealth of the donor, splitting liabilities among beneficiaries with separate tax deductions applicable for each.
South Korea is one of four member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development currently imposing estate tax, while most others levy inheritance tax. The other three are the United States, Britain and Denmark.
OECD recommended in a 2021 report that ""a recipient-based inheritance tax may be more equitable than an estate tax"", as it encourages the division of estates and reduces concentrations.
Last year, the administration of now-impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol proposed removing the highest tax rate of 50%, as high inheritance taxes have often been cited as a factor behind the ""Korea discount"" in the domestic stock market, which refers to South Korean firms' comparatively lower valuations.
At the time, the move was met by criticism from the left-leaning opposition Democratic Party that has a majority in parliament, although its leader Lee Jae-myung recently agreed that some codes needed to be revised in a more rational way.
""Today's announcement only includes what is absolutely necessary,"" a finance ministry official told a briefing, adding that other revisions proposed last year would continue to be pursued.
The government plans to implement the changes announced on Wednesday from 2028. They still require approval from parliament.

India’s February merchandise trade deficit narrows to its lowest in over 3 years,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-february-merchandise-trade-deficit-narrows-to-its-lowest-in-over-3-years-11742206113858.html,"By Manoj Kumar and Shubham Batra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's merchandise trade deficit in February narrowed sharply to $14.05 billion, the lowest level in more than three years, as imports fell amid rising global uncertainty.
The deficit was much lower than economists' forecast of $21.65 billion, according to a Reuters poll.
February's merchandise exports stood at $36.91 billion against $36.43 billion in January, while imports were lower at $50.96 billion compared with $59.42 billion in the month prior.
February imports were the lowest since April 2023 and the trade deficit was lower than the latest figure in August 2021.
""These are quick estimates. We are looking into the details of (the) fall in imports,"" trade official Satya Srinivas told reporters.
In February, India's gold imports slipped to $2.3 billion from the previous month's $2.68 billion, while crude oil imports dropped to $11.8 billion from $13.4 billion in January, data showed.
Services exports in February were estimated at $35.03 billion and imports at $16.55 billion, against $38.55 billion and $18.22 billion, respectively, in January.
The data comes at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has upended the globe with his widening tariff policy. India is trying to strike a bilateral trade pact with the U.S. to avoid the wrath of its reciprocal tariff likely to be implemented from April 2.
""India is proactively engaged with the U.S. to address concerns of both countries and expand trade to $500 billion,"" India's Trade Secretary Sunil Barthwal said.

India levies anti-dumping duty on 5 Chinese goods. Here’s why,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-imposes-anti-dumping-duty-on-4-chinese-products-11742715371837.html,"To safeguard domestic players from cheap imports, India has imposedanti-dumping dutyon five Chinese goods, including vacuum flasks and aluminum foil, during the month so far.
These duties were levied as the five products — Soft Ferrite Cores, certain thickness of vacuum insulated flask, aluminum foil, Trichloro Isocyanuric Acid, and Poly Vinyl Chloride Paste Resin -- were being imported from China at below normal prices.
The move comes after recommendations for imposing duties were made by the Union Commerce Ministry's investigation arm Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR ).
The duty imposed ""shall be levied for a period of five years"" on imports of Soft Ferrite Cores, vacuum insulated flask, and Trichloro Isocyanuric Acid, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs said in separate notifications.
The anti-dumping duty of up to $873 per tonne was imposed provisionally on aluminum foil for six months.
On imports of the acid (a water treatment chemical) from China and Japan, the duty has been imposed in the range of $276 per tonne to $986 per tonne.
On imports of Soft Ferrite Cores (used in electric vehicles, chargers, and telecom devices), up to 35 per cent duty was imposed on CIF (cost, insurance freight) value.
Similarly, imports of vacuum insulated flask attracted anti-dumping duty of $1,732 per tonne.
The levy, which ranges from $89 per tonne to $707 per tonne on Poly Vinyl Chloride Paste Resin was slapped on the imports from China, Korea RP, Malaysia, Norway, Taiwan and Thailand for five years.
The commerce ministry has recommended the imposition of a 12 per cent provisional safeguard duty for 200 days on certainsteel productswith an aim to protect domestic players from a surge in imports.
In December 2024, the DGTR started the probe into the sudden surge in imports of 'Non-Alloy and Alloy Steel Flat Products', used in various industries, including fabrication, pipe making, construction, capital goods, auto, tractors, bicycles, and electrical panels.
In a notification dated March 18, the DGTR said that there exist critical circumstances, where any delay in application of provisional safeguard measures would cause damage which would be difficult to repair.
Anti-dumping probes are conducted by countries to determine whether domestic industries have been hurt because of a surge in cheap imports.
As a countermeasure, they impose these duties under the multilateral regime of Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO).
The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trading practices and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers vis-a-vis foreign producers and exporters.
India and China both are members of the WTO. China is the second largest trading partner of India. The country has time and again flagged serious concerns over the widening trade deficit with the neighbouring country which stood at $85 billion in 2023-24.

RBI to Meet Bankers Next Week to Discuss New Liquidity Model,https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-to-meet-bankers-next-week-to-discuss-new-liquidity-model-11743055726463.html,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s central bank is set to meet lenders next week to discuss changes in its liquidity management framework so that borrowing costs are better anchored to the policy rate, according to people familiar with the developments.
The Reserve Bank of India is scheduled to meet bank economists on April 3 to take feedback on proposed revisions that include considering shorter-maturity repurchase operations, the people said, asking not to be named discussing private matters. The central bank’s main tool currently is a 14-day cash window.
An internal central bank panel has reviewed the liquidity framework and a revised one could be announced in coming weeks, the people said.
READ: India’s Cash Crunch Spurs RBI to Weigh More Liquidity Infusions
The discussions on the liquidity framework come at a time when the central bank has been cutting interest rates and injecting large amounts of cash into the financial system as it seeks to boost economic growth.
The central bank may consider using repurchase operations of different maturities, including shorter-tenor ones, the people said. Pro-actively using overnight or other short-tenor variable rate repurchase operations is an option on the table, they said. The central bank did not immediately respond to an email seeking a comment on the matter.
In a seeming step in that direction, the RBI announced indefinite daily variable rate repurchase operations in January, as it sought to quell a severe cash deficit in the system.
Repurchase operations are a mechanism used by the RBI to provide short-term funds to banks. When the central bank wishes to drain excess funds from lenders it uses reverse repurchase operations.
Since the introduction of the existing framework in February 2020, there have been several instances where banks’ overnight borrowing costs have sharply diverged from the RBI’s policy rate. This poses challenges for the transmission of the RBI’s rate changes to the broader economy.
The RBI’s rate-setting panel will announce its next policy statement on April 9.
